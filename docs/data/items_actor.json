              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

The family of Aleksi\u0107 von Maina bore five captains, two majors, two colonels and two generals. They served in the armed forces of Venice, France and Austria.

He was ennobled and elevated to knighthood (Ritterstand) in 1840. After his retirement in 1844, when he was promoted to the rank of Field marshal-lieutenant, he moved to Vienna, where he stayed for the next eleven years. He lived at first (already before 1853) in Johannesgasse 969 (the so-called \"Fleischhof\", today Johannesgasse 1, 1010 Vienna).

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Aleksi\u0107 was born in Palermo in a noble family, whose ancestors had moved from Montenegrin mountains to the Boka Kotorska in 1621. The family of Aleksi\u0107 von Maina bore five captains, two majors, two colonels and two generals. They served in the armed forces of Venice, France and Austria. His father's uncle Rade Maina was promoted to the rank of General in the Republic of Venice in 1779. Teodor's father Jovan Aleksi\u0107 von Maina was promoted to the rank of the General in the Austrian army in 1835. In 1849 Teodor Aleksi\u0107 von Maina was awarded with the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd class. And in 1858 he married Anastasija (Stana) Obrenovi\u0107, the daughter of Jovan Obrenovi\u0107 (1787-1850) and the niece of the Serbian Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (1780-1860). They had three daughters. In 1863 he became an adjutant of the Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). He remained in this position until 1866 and was promoted to the rank of Major. Teodor Aleksi\u0107 von Maina was awarded with the Knight's Cross (with swords) of the Order of Duke Adolph I of Nassau in 1863. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel on 7 April 1866, while he served in the 4th Infantry Regiment in Slunj (today in Croatia). Teodor Aleksi\u0107 von Maina died in Novi Sad (today in Serbia) in 1891. He was the last male descendant of the house Aleksi\u0107 von Maina."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Aleksandar Andri\u0107 (1816-1876) joined the Military Academy in Vienna and graduated in 1832. He was an officer in the Austrian army in the Military Frontier until 1850. After that he received a pension in the rank of Sub-lieutenant. Andri\u0107 was also a writer and published his poems and novels from 1840. He is mostly known for editing his journal \"Svetovid\", first in Timi\u0219oara (today in Romania) in 1852 and at the end of that year in Vienna until 1859. He also published \"Svetozar\" as addition to \"Svetovid\" and from 13 July to 12 October 1856 as a separate edition. Apart from the newspaper, Andri\u0107 printed two of his books in Vienna, namely a history of Montenegro entitled \"Geschichte des F\u00fcrstenthums Montenegro von den \u00e4ltesten Zeiten bis zum Jahre 1852\" in 1853 and the Slavic Calender entitled \"\u00d6sterreichischer Slaven-Kalender f\u00fcr das Jahr 1858\" in 1857. Moreover, he printed his calender \"Zimzelen\" for the years 1858, 1859 and 1860. \r\nIn May 1859 he was accused of anti-Austrian propaganda. His journal was banned for the next three months, and Andri\u0107 fled to Serbia. Later he was sentenced to six months in prison. The reason for this was his poem on Montenegro. After 1859 he moved to Belgrade, where he continued to publish \"Svetovid\" and also other books in his publishing house. He was a member of the \"Srpsko u\u010deno dru\u0161tvo\" (today the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) and of the \"Matica Srpska\". He died in Bucharest in 1876.\r\n\r\n"

On 12 June 1867 he was ennobled and elevated to knighthood (Ritterstand) by the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). In 1882 Sava Arlov was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Leopold (Ritterkreuz des Leopold Ordens). He was promoted to the rank of Major General in 1883 and to the rank of Field marshal-lieutenant in 1887. In 1888, on the occasion of his 40 year jubilee in the Austrian army, he was decorated by Emperor Franz Joseph I with the Order of the Iron Crown 2nd class (Orden der Eisernen Krone 2. Klasse mit Kriegsdekoration). Soon after that he retired and died in his apartment in Posthorngasse 5 (1030 Vienna) on 30 May 1903. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt 13 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) on 2 June 1903."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In 1905 Arnovljevi\u0107 started to work in the \"K.K. Direktion f\u00fcr den Bau der Wasserstra\u00dfen\". In his memoirs the Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovi\u0107 (1879-1958) mentioned his friend and colleguae Arnovljevi\u0107 as one of the first Serbian doctors of technical sciences. Based on Milankovi\u0107's sugegstion In 1910 Dr. Ivan Arnovljevi\u0107 was elected for Professor of Mechanics at the Technical Faculty of the University of Belgrade in 1910. His main scientific interest were problems concerning stresses in steel girders and coupled systems. His teaching at University dealt mainly with the fields of mechanics, geometry and statics.

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He studied at the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts (then in the Annakloster, 1010 Vienna) from 1836 to 1840. Being a friend of the Serbian philologist and linguist Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864), he painted his portrait in Vienna in 1840. This painting (oil on canvas) is preserved today in the Serbian National Museum (\"Narodni Muzej\") in Belgrade. He painted also the iconostases in many Serbian Orthodox Churches. The most valuable is the iconostasis in the St. Michael's Cathedral (\"Saborna Crkva\") in Belgrade (1841-1845). From 1852 he lived in Novi Sad, where he died on 1 March 1855."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was one of the founders of the company \"Gebr\u00fcder Baich\" together with his brothers Teodor and Jovan in 1877. This company was dissolved in 1892. Already in the Cataster from 1869 the brothers Luka and Jovan von Baji\u0107 are mentioned as owners of the house in Simmeringer Hauptstra\u00dfe 46 and Am Kanal 37 (it is the same object with entrances on both streets). The old Cataster number was Hauptstra\u00dfe No. 277. This building still exists. Jovan and Luka von Baji\u0107 donated 300 florins for the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna. \r\nHis father's grandfather, Jovan Baji\u0107, was ennobled in 1791. Luka von Baji\u0107 was a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava in Vienna as well as its President from 6 September 1894 until 1897. The company of Luka von Baji\u0107 for cattle trade was located on Zentralviehmarkt (1030 Vienna) and was registered on 17 March 1901. Before that he was also registered as importer of cattle from 11 October 1898. Luka von Baji\u0107 was deleted from the register after his death in 1907. His company continued to work under his son Petar von Baji\u0107. In 1899 Luka sold together with Milan, Ljubica and Desanka von Baji\u0107 a house in Sch\u00fctzengasse 17 (1030 Vienna) (still exists). Luka von Baji\u0107 died on 23 March 1907 at the age of 67 in his apartment in Barichgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) (does not exist anymore). He was buried in the Serbian part 68B of the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) on 25 March 1907. \r\nHis wife Ljubica was born in the family Ostoji\u0107. Luka's son, Teodor von Baji\u0107 (1870-1895) died on 8 May 1895 at the age of 25 in the house Sch\u00fctzengasse 17 (1030 Vienna)."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Its address at that time was in Vienna's city centre, namely house No. 589 (that is Bauernmarkt 2a, 1010 Vienna, does not exist anymore). Jovan Barbulovi\u0107 was exporting his products even to Italy and the Orient. \r\nIn 1848 his company was to be found in Bauernmarkt No. 581 (that is Bauernmarkt 11, 1010 Vienna, does not exist anymore) and, apart from ties, he was selling also shirts, collars, gloves, hats, braces, etc. His motto was \u201cEleganz, Solidit\u00e4t, Billigkeit\". In 1849 he moved to the first floor of the house Graben No. 619 (the so-called \"Elephantenhaus\", does not exist anymore, today Stock-im-Eisen-Platz).

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

She married Count (Graf) Richard von Bienerth-Schmerling (1863-1918) in the Schottenkirche (1010 Vienna) on 7 January 1893. He was Prime Minister of the Austrian part of the Habsburg Empire from 1908 to 1911 and the grandson of Anton von Schmerling (1805-1893). Anka Bienerth was awarded with the title of Lady-in-waiting or Court lady (Palastdame) by Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) on 29 March 1909.  Before that, in 1908, she was decorated with the Order of Elizabeth 1st class. Anna-Anka Bienerth was well-known for her charitable work and was also very popular in the Viennese public life. In 1914 she founded the so-called \"Schwarz-gelbes Kreuz\", a charity organisation whose first president she was. Later, she was honorary president of the \"Komitee f\u00fcr Kinderern\u00e4hrung und \u00f6ffentliche Ausspeisung\" (until 1926). For her charitable work Countess Anna-Anka Bienerth-Schmerling was awarded the Eiserne Salvatormedalle by the authorities of the City of Vienna in 1919. Her son Rudolf died in 1921 and her daughter Marie in 1935. She died in her apartment in Stadiongasse 2 (1010 Vienna) on 14 July 1937 and was buried in the family tomb in the Hietzing Cemetery (Hietzinger Friedhof, 1130 Vienna) two days later."

After attending grammar school in Venice, he studied Law in Munich, Vienna (1861-1863), Berlin and Paris. At the University of Gie\u00dfen he received a PhD in Philosophy in 1862 and then a PhD in Law in Vienna in 1865. After that Bogi\u0161i\u0107 stayed in Vienna, where he succeeded Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891) at his position in the Imperial Court Library (\"Kaiserliche Hofbibliothek\") in Vienna until 1868. He collected folk poems under the influence of the work done by Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864). Influenced by Panslavism he was one of the founders of the society \"Slovenska beseda\" in Vienna and of this society's library. From 1869 to 1872 Bogi\u0161i\u0107 was Professor of Slavic Law at the University of Odessa. Later, he moved to Paris, but his main work was the codification of the Civil Law in Montenegro, where he was Minister of Justice (1893-1899). Bogi\u0161i\u0107 was awarded with the Russian Order of St. Anna Order 2nd class, the Commander Cross of the French Legion of Merit, the Serbian Order of St. Sava 1st class and the Montenegrin Danilo Order 1st class. He was ennobled in Russia. In 1902 Valtazar Bogi\u0161i\u0107 was elected as President of International Institute of Sociology. "

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was the only South Slav, who reached the highest rank in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Borojevi\u0107 was born in the Military Frontier in an officer's family. From 1887 to 1891 Borojevi\u0107 lectured Military tactics at the Theresian Military Academy (\"Theresianische Milit\u00e4rakademie\") in Wiener Neustadt. In 1913 he was promoted to the rank of a General of Infantry. The Infantry Regiment No. 51 was named in his honour. In the First World War (1914-1918) Borojevi\u0107 led successfully operations against the Italian Army at the Isonzo Front, first as Comnmander of the 5th Army. Later his troops were united under his name as \"Army Group Borojevi\u0107\". Due to his military merits he was decorated with the Military Order of Maria Theresia and on 1 February 1918 he was promoted to the rank of Field marshal. He died in Klagenfurt on 23 May 1920, where he was buried. Upon demand of the last Austrian Emperor Karl I (1887-1922) his mortal remains were transferred to a grave of honor in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) on 27 October 1920. Several thousand officers of the former Austro-Hungarian Army were present at this funeral. "

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Jovan \u010cokor (1849-1911) was born as Johann Nepomuk Csokor on 4 April 1849 and was baptised on 6 April in the Roman Catholic church of St. Leopold (1020 Vienna). He was born in the house No. 371 in Leopoldstadt (today Gro\u00dfe Stadtgutgasse 11, 1020 Vienna). His father was Aleksandar \u010cokor (1815-1884) and his mother Anna Schindler (1818-1856). He started his education at Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) at his uncle the Archimandrite Julijan \u010cokor and stayed there from 1854 to 1864. After that he finished the grammar school in Pest in 1866 and continued to study medicine in Vienna. Jovan \u010cokor was promoted to Dr. of Medicine in 1873. In 1875 he graduated in Veterinary Science and gained a position as assistant at the Department of Anatomy and Physiology in Vienna. He gave lectures on Histology and Parasitology and introduced histological-microscopic teaching at the University. \r\n\r\nJovan \u010cokor married Emilie M\u00fcller on 28 July 1877 in Vienna. They had five children: \r\nEmilie Sofia Maria \u010cokor (6 June 1878), \r\nFranz Theodor \u010cokor (8 September 1885 - 5 January 1969), \r\nJohann \u010cokor (22 October 1886 - 1915),\r\nEugenie \u010cokor (24 November 1887 - 1979),\r\nSofie \u010cokor (6 July 1891 - 1967). \r\n\r\nFrom 1876 as a temporary and from 1879 as a permanent Lecturer at the Chair of Zoology, \u010cokor was appointed as Professor of General Pathology and Forensic Veterinary Medicine in Vienna in 1880. In 1884 he deepened his knowledge by working together with Robert Koch (1843-1910) in Berlin. Already from 1889 he was also an eminent Professor of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases and turned more to parasitology. In 1906 a chair was established for this discipline. \u010cokor also founded and widely publicised diagnostic vaccine stations. In addition, he taught as a Privatdozent from 1890 and as a Professor of Veterinary Medicine from 1895 at the University of Vienna. In 1909 he retired as Professor. \r\nJovan \u010cokor published regularly in several scientific journals, namely the \"\u00d6sterreichische Vierteljahresschrift f\u00fcr wissenschaftliche Veterin\u00e4rkunde\", \"Allgemeine Wiener Medizinische Zeitung\" and \"Wiener Wochenschrift\". He published a \"Lehrbuch der gerichtlichen Thierheilkunde\" (1898, 2nd ed. 1902). He received the Knight's Cross in 1898 and the Officer's Cross of the Franz Josef Order in 1909. He was Knight of the Serbian Order of Saint Sava and a member of the Society of Doctors as well as honorary member of the Serbian Society of Doctors in Belgrade. Finally, he bore the title of \"Hofrat\". Jovan \u010cokor died on 7 January 1911 in his apartment in M\u00f6dling (Jasomirgottgasse 8) and was buried on the local cemetery."

He grew up in Timi\u0219oara (today Romania), where he finished grammar school. In autumn 1913 he moved to Vienna, where he studied Medicine. In his work \"Komentari\" (\"Comments\") he described his Viennese days. He lived in Piaristengasse 54 (1080 Vienna) in the guesthouse of Mrs. Thiess. Crnjanski was a member of the Serbian Students' Association \"Zora\". His memoirs are very interesting, especially because of the events on and after 28 June 1914. Crnjanski played pool in Meinl Caf\u00e9 on that day, when he heard the news about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863-1914) in Sarajevo. Early in the morning on that day he was on a meeting with Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian students in honour of the Serbian national day \u2013 Vidovdan. On the same evening a ball was organised for the same reason, but due to the evolving political and diplomatic situation it was cancelled. As a Serbian student and member of the Serbian Students' Association \"Zora\", Crnjanski was, as the others, suspicious in the eyes of the Viennese police. Shortly after that, Crnjanski moved to Novi Sad, and later he was arrested and mobilised in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the First World War (1914-1918) he moved to Belgrade, where he studied literature and worked as a teacher and newspaper editor (of the newspaper \"Ideje\"). From 1935 Milo\u0161 Crnjanski was in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in Rome and Berlin. Together with the government he escaped from the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 to London via Lisbon. In London he continued his diplomatic activities as a member of a recognised Allied country. After the Second World War (1939-1945) he stayed in London in exile as an enemy of the newly established Communist regime in Socialist Yugoslavia. He returned to Belgrade from exile twenty years later, in 1965, where he died in 1977. His most famous book was \"Seobe\" (\"Migrations\"), which describes the life of the Serbs in the Austrian Empire in the 18th century. "

He was a famous Austrian writer, poet and dramatic advisor of Serbian origin. His father was Jovan \u010cokor (1849-1911), Professor at the University of Vienna. After studying History of Art and German Philology at the University of Vienna, he wrote his first works between 1912 and 1918 (e.g. \"Die Gewalten\", \"Die S\u00fcnde wider den Geist\u2019\", \"Die rote Stra\u00dfe\" etc). From 1922 to 1928 he was a dramatic advisor at the Raimundtheater and the Volkstheater in Vienna, and later he became President of the Austrian PEN Club. From 1968 he was Vice-President of International PEN Club. Csokor received amongst others the Literarurpreis der Stadt Wien in 1927, the Burgtheaterring in 1938, the Grillparzer Preis in 1938 and the Gro\u00dfer \u00d6sterreichischer Staatspreis in 1955. Since 1933 he had risen his voice against the persecution of writers in Germany, which led to a ban of his books there. It is interesting that Csokor, who was a great humanist and enemy of National Socialism, was in exile since 1938 and that he lived in Yugoslavia, the country of his ancestors, from 1941 to 1944. He described this period in his autobiographic work \"Als Zivilist im Balkankrieg\" (Vienna 1947). However, his most popular work was \"3 November 1918\", which was staged in the Burgtheater in Vienna. Franz Theodor Maria Csokor died on 5 January 1969 in the Franz Josefs Spital in Vienna and was buried in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna)."

              "value": "Jovan Cviji\u0107 (1865-1927) is the best-known Serbian geologist and geographer. He was born on 12 October 1865 in Loznica (Serbia). After attending grammar school in Loznica and \u0160abac, he studied Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the Faculty of the High School in Belgrade from 1885 to 1888. After completing his studies, he began his systematic field trips through the Balkan Peninsula for the next 38 years. Jovan Cviji\u0107 researched more than 500,000 square kilometers of territory. In autumn 1889 he came to Vienna as a scholarship holder. He attended lectures on Physical Geography and Cartography. On 22 January 1893 he was promoted to Dr. His PhD was entitled \"Das Karstph\u00e4nomen\" (\"The Karst Phenomenon\"). For the first time this work was printed in Vienna in the autumn of the same year. Great influence on the young Jovan Cviji\u0107 had his professors at the University of Vienna (i.e. Eduard Suess, Albrecht Penck, Julius Hann and Wilhelm Tomascheck). He often had meetings with Professor Albrecht Penck (1858-1945), where the topic of conversation was the geography of the Balkan Peninsula. His dissertation is still considered to be a fundamental work in the field of Karstology. Jovan Cviji\u0107 was the leading Karstologist of his generation, and probably the greatest Karstologist of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He has often been called the \"Father of Karst Studies\". \r\nIt is also important to say that Jovan Cviji\u0107 introduced several Serbian words to the scientific terminology, like Polje, Dolina, Uvala. From 1893 until his death in 1927 he was a Professor, first at the High School in Belgrade, and from 1905 (after the conversion of the High School in Belgrade to the University of Belgrade on 27 February 1905) full Professor of the University of Belgrade. He was also twice Rector of the University of Belgrade (1907/08 and 1919/20) and President of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) from 1921 to 1927. \r\nJovan Cviji\u0107 was the founder of the Serbian Geographical Society (\"Srpsko geografsko dru\u0161tvo\", 1910) and the journal of the Serbian Geographical Society (\"Glasnik Srpskog geografskog dru\u0161tva\", 1912), which is still published today. In addition to his fundamental works on Geomorphology, Geography and Geology his anthropological and ethnographic publications are outstanding. He was the founder of the Serbian settlement research. \r\nJovan Cviji\u0107 played an eminent role in the Paris Peace Conference after the First World War (1919/20). He was the head of the Serbian ethnographic-historical department (in this delegation were, amongst others, the Serbian historians and former Viennese students Tihomir Djordjevi\u0107, Jovan Radoni\u0107 and StanojeStanojevi\u0107). This department had collected scholarly, statistical and cartographic data for the negotiations. \r\nIn 1897 Jovan Cviji\u0107 published his map of Serbia and Montenegro in Vienna, which was used in the schools. The map is printed on a scale of 1: 750,000, and in the left corner one can find the map of Belgrade on a scale 1: 75,000. This map symbolises a great advancement in Serbian cartography and marked the beginning of a new era in Serbian cartography. \r\n\r\nJovan Cviji\u0107 was a honorary doctor of the Sorbonne University and the Charles University in Prague and a member of all major geographical societies in Europe at that time (Vienna, Paris, London, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin etc.). He received several scientific prizes in the field of Geography. Jovan Cviji\u0107 died on 16 January 1927 in Belgrade.\r\n\r\n"

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 (1825-1882) was a Serbian philologist, translator and linguistic historian. He was born in Novi Sad on 4 April 1825 as Djordje Popovi\u0107. After attending the grammar school in Bratislava, he came to Vienna in order to study Law in 1845. He had already been a supporter of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's ideas, and in Vienna he became one of Vuk's most important associates. In Vuk's house he became acquainted with the Bishop Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 of Montenegro, Ljuba Nenadovi\u0107, Danilo Medakovi\u0107, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107, Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 and many others. His best friend in Vienna was the Serbian poet Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107. Already in 1846 he gave up his studies in Law and turned to Philology. His professor was Franz von Miklosich. Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 spoke Latin, German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak and Russian, before he moved to Vienna. As Vuk's most dedicated follower he printed brochures, in which he supported Vuk's ideas. His most important text was \"The War for the Serbian Language and Orthography\" (\"\u0420\u0430\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\") printed in Pest in 1847. He signed this publication as Djura Dani\u010di\u0107. He took his new last name after Vuk's journal \"Danica\". Since 1849 he lived in Landstra\u00dfe 487 (today Beatrixgasse 12, 1030 Vienna). He helped Vuk in the new edition of his \"Dictionary\" (\"\u0420\u0458\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\") and in 1852 he moved to Belgrade. After only one year (in 1853) he returned to Vienna on the invitation of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 in order to teach the Serbian Princess Julija. For three years Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 was the teacher of the Princess, and she became his benefactor, financially supporting the printing of his books. In 1860 he translated the Old Testament into Serbian. It is interesting to mention that he taught Serbian also to Princess Natalija Obrenovi\u0107 in Paris in 1876. In Vienna he printed his \"Small Serbian Grammar\" (\"\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\", 1850) and \"New Serbian Spelling Grammar\" (\"\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\", 1854). Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 settled in Belgrade in 1856 as a grammar school teacher and in 1866 he moved to Zagreb, where he died on 17 November 1882."

Josif Danilovac studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\") from 1896. From 1908 he worked as a caricaturist in the newspaper \"Die Muskete\". Josif Danilovac signed a contract with the model railway company \"M\u00e4rklin\", for which he drew catalogues until 1940. He married Maria Lasus in 1913, and they had a son called Marko and a daughter called Angelina. After 1938 he was banned from his work in the newspapers, because of his critique of the Nazi regime and because his wife was of Jewish origin. He died in his apartment in Gymnasiumstra\u00dfe 29 (1180 Vienna) on 20 November 1945, where he lived since 1940. Josif Danilovac was buried after a memorial service in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna in a grave of honor at the Cemetery of D\u00f6bling. The Council Committee for Culture (\"Gemeinderatsausschu\u00df f\u00fcr Kultur\") of the City of Vienna named a street, Danilovatzgasse, in the 12th and 23rd Viennese districts after him on 8 June 1955."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

After his return to Serbia he was the secretary of Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (1780-1860), Minister of Education and diplomat. In 1835 he was the creator of the first Serbian constitution. He was also a publisher and editor of the \"Novine Srbske\" in Serbia in the years 1834/1835.\r\nDavidovi\u0107's father, Gavrilo Georgijevi\u0107, was an Orthodox priest in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Vienna. Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107 took his last name after his grandfather, David Georgijevi\u0107, who was a teacher and Orthodox priest in Zemun and in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). Davidovi\u0107 came to Vienna together with Dimitrije Fru\u0161i\u0107 (1790-1838) in autumn 1812. They were both students of Medicine. Supported by Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), the imperial censor for Slavic languages, they started to publish the Serbian newspaper \"Novine serbske\" in 1813. Davidovi\u0107 and Fru\u0161i\u0107 were the owners, editors and publishers of this newspaper, which was published until February 1822. During the Congress of Vienna (\"Wiener Kongre\u00df\") in 1814 they helped the former Serbian Minister Matija Nenadovi\u0107 substantially to inform the Great European Powers on the Serbian question. From 1818 to 1822 Davidovi\u0107 had his own printing house in Fleischmarkt 746 (1010 Vienna). On 1 October 1818 he received a privilege for printing books in Oriental languages. He left Vienna in autumn 1821 and the editor's position to his co-worker, Petar Mati\u0107, a law student from Zemun. He married Jelisaveta-Savka Diamandi on 30 May 1817 in Pest. They lived in the house Innere Stadt 699 (1010 Vienna). Jelisaveta died during childbirth on 23 May 1818 in this house at the age of 35. She was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) on 25 May 1818. Their son was named Svetozar (he died in Vienna in the 1850s). Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107 married one year later his second wife, Jelena, on 26 January 1819. They had the sons Milan, Jovan (born in Vienna in 1820) and a daughter Savka (born in Serbia about 1828 and died 1841). Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107 published in Vienna his two books \"Sobranie nauka svakomu \u010doveku nu\u017edni\" (1814) and \"Dejanija k istoriji Srbskoga naroda\" (1821). \r\n\r\n"

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In 1863 he received a scholarship by the Serbian government in order to study Medicine at the University of Vienna. His first apartment was in Wieden (1040 Vienna), and he attended lectures at the Theresianum. His professors were renowned experts in medicine: Josef von \u0160koda (1805-1881), Theodor Billroth (1829-1894) and Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894). During his studies he regularly attended performances in the Burgtheater. Vladan Djordjevi\u0107 graduated in 1869 and in the same year he became Doctor of Medicine and Surgery. During his studies in Vienna he met his future wife Pauline Bitner. They married in Belgrade in 1871. In 1870 he became a member of the Society of Physicians in Vienna (\"Gesellschaft der \u00c4rzte in Wien\"). Djordjevi\u0107 was the founder of the Serbian Physicians' Society (\"Srpsko Lekarsko Dru\u0161tvo\") in 1872 and of the Serbian Red Cross in 1876. Then Vladan Djordjevi\u0107 started a political career. He was mayor of Belgrade (1884-1888), Minister of Education (1888-1889), ambassador in Athens (1891-1893) and Constantinople (1894-1897) and Prime Minister (1897-1900). In 1888 he became a corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy and four years later (1892) a full member. After a conflict with the Serbian King Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 (1876-1903), Djordjevi\u0107 moved to Vienna in 1900, where he wrote his memoirs and articles for different Viennese newspapers (e.g. the Neue Freie Presse, Wiener Tagblatt, Wiener Abendblatt, etc.). He returned to Belgrade in 1905. In 1920 Vladan Djordjevi\u0107 returned to Vienna, where he lived in a rented apartment in Rien\u00f6\u00dflgasse 24 (1040 Vienna) until 1924. He collected sources from Viennese archives for his books. Because of illness he had to stay in different Viennese Sanatoria. In 1930 Djordjevi\u0107 moved to a Sanatorium in Baden, where he died on 31 August 1930."

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was born in Osijek (Military Frontier, today Croatia) in a merchant's family of Serbian origin in 1756. Duka began a very long military career in 1776. After the victorious Battle of Famars (1793) against the French Revolutionary Army he became Knight of the Maria Theresia Order. In 1800 Duka was promoted to Major General. He became commander of the fortress in Timi\u0219oara (today Romania) and in 1813 General of the Artillery (\"Feldzeugsmeister\"). In 1815 Duka was honored with the title of \"k. k. Geheimer Rat\" by the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835). The Infantry Regiment No. 39 carried his name since 1803. Apart from the Large Cross of the Leopold Order he was also the holder of many Russian, Prussian, Bavarian, French and Sicilian decorations. Duka received Hungarian nobility with the rank of \"Baron\" and became the owner of the landed property Kadar in Banat (today Romania). Therefore, his title was \"de Kadar\" or \"von Kadar\". From 1815 he was a member of the State Council (\"Staatsrat\") and because of that he settled in Vienna. Petar Duka de Kadar died on 29 December 1822 in the house in Renngasse 10 (1010 Vienna). He was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) and in 1907 his mortal remains were exhumed and buried in Kadar."

              "value": "Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 Jr. (1855-1936?) was a Serbian diplomat, journalist and astronomer born in Trieste in 1855. His father was Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 Sr. (1809-1861), one of the richest Serbs in the Habsburg Empire. After his father's death in 1861, the young Spiridon lived in Vienna with his mother and his sister. After attending St. Anna Jesuit school he studied at the grammar school in Melk until 1869. In 1874 and 1875 he was at the Viennese Conservatorium. Here Gop\u010devi\u0107 had financial support from General Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 (1822-1908), whom Gop\u010devi\u0107's father had helped during the Revolution of 1848 in the battle against the Hungarians. In 1875 Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 Jr. took part in Montenegrin uprising against the Turks, and later he became correspondent of many Austrian newspapers. Gop\u010deci\u0107 wrote many books and pamphlets on the history, ethnology and politics in the Balkan Peninsula. From 1886 to 1887 he was the Serbian attach\u00e9 in Berlin and from 1887 to 1890 in Vienna. In 1886 he married Franziska Praskowitz in Vienna. Their son Spiridon was born in Trieste in 1883 and their daughter Danica in Vienna in 1888. Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 Jr. was the owner and editor of the Viennese newspaper \"Wiener Tagespost\" from May 1890 until January 1891. He corresponded with many European artists and statesmen, amongst others with Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898), Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898) and Victor Hugo (1802-1885). In 1891 he left Vienna and moved to Celje (today Slovenia) and then in 1893 to the island of Mali Lo\u0161inj (today Croatia). There he founded the observatory named \"Manora\" and published many works in the field of Astronomy under the pseudonym Leo Brenner. Spiridon Gop\u010devi\u0107 Jr. stayed there until 1908 and published the a journal on Astronomy called \"Astronomische Rundschau\", which was issued monthly from 1899 to 1908. He travelled through the USA, Siberia, the Middle East and North Africa. From ca. 1909 to 1912 he lived in the USA and later moved to Berlin, where he stayed until the end of his life. The date of his death is unknown. The most common years which are mentioned in encyclopaedias are 1928 and 1936."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time.

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was baptised on 27 May 1860 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna). His father was the Viennese jeweller and inventor Mihailo Ili\u0107. Aleksandar Ili\u0107 studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\") from 1879 to 1880 and from 1884 to 1890. Already during his studies, Aleksandar Ili\u0107 received a scholarship and awards. He had the \"Rechenberg Stipendium\" (75 florins) in 1882/83, received support by the \"Aushilfsfond\" (120 florins) in 1883/4 and had the \"Franz Joseph Goldenes Stipendium\" (300 florins) from 1885 to 1888. In 1890 he received a scholarship called \"Schwendenwein Reisestipendium\" and travelled to Italy (Rome) and Germany until 1892. Aleksandar Ili\u0107 was awarded the \"F\u00fcger-Preis\" in silver in 1883, the \"Gundel-Preis\" in silver in 1884 and the \"Spezialschul-Preis\" in 1888. His works in Vienna are to be found for example in the Donaufelderkirche (1210 Vienna) dating to 1909 (Busts of Capistran, Floridus and Koloman, the Family Altar, reliefs of the Passion of Christ and relief in the Baptism Chapel). From 1901 to 1903 Aleksandar Ili\u0107 made sandstone statues for the municipal office in Florisdorf. On 29 December 1899 he became a member of the \"K\u00fcnstlerhaus\". In 1909 he was awarded the \"Dumba Art Prize\" (\"Dumba-K\u00fcnstlerpreis\") for his work \"Es ist vollbracht!\". He lived from 1914 until his death in Peter-Jordan-Stra\u00dfe 100 (1190 Vienna). Aleksandar Ili\u0107 died on 8 January 1943 in Vienna and was buried in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) in the family tomb next to his father."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was born in Budjanovci (today Serbia) on 10 December 1881. Aleksandar Ivi\u0107 studied History and Slavonic Studies at the University of Vienna from 1901 to 1905. He had a scholarship of the Matica Srpska. His professors were amongst others Vatroslav Jagi\u0107 (1838-1923), Milan von Re\u0161etar (1860-1942) and Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek (1854-1918). He received his PhD on 20 December 1905. His dissertation dealt with the medieval nobleman Radoslav Pavlovi\u0107. After his studies Aleksandar \"Aleksa\" Ivi\u0107 stayed in Vienna for five years, where he conducted research in the Austrian Archives and published many written sources on the Serbs in the Habsburg Empire. From 1910 to 1912 he was a deputy in the Croatian Parliament, and later he worked in the Archive of Zagreb. After the First World War Aleksandar \"Aleksa\" Ivi\u0107 was a Professor of Diplomatic History at the Faculty of Law in Subotica, which was a department of the University of Belgrade. He died in Belgrade on 23 November 1948."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

After his education in Szeged and Pest (today Hungary), he wanted to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\") and therefore moved to Vienna in 1851. Unfortunately, because of financial issues, he did not succeed. However, during one year which Djura Jak\u0161i\u0107 spent in Vienna, he visited exhibitions, museums, galleries and he painted a lot. He was the roommate of Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Jovan Zmaj (1833-1904) and friend of the painters Novak Radoni\u0107 and Stevan Todorovi\u0107. In 1852 he returned home to Srpska Crnja (today Serbia), and soon afterwards he went to Munich and spent one year at the Academy of Fine Arts. After a few years in Kikinda (today Serbia), Djura Jak\u0161i\u0107 moved to Serbia in 1856, where he worked as a school teacher until 1872 in many cities (Belgrade, Po\u017earevac, Kragujevac, Jagodina, etc.). From 1861 to 1862 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. His benefactor in Vienna was Hariton Joanovi\u0107 (1824-1884), the secretary of Baron Simon von Sina (1810-1876). Joanovi\u0107 supported Jak\u0161i\u0107 financially and helped him to sell his paintings. As a sign of gratitude, Djura Jak\u0161i\u0107 gave him as a present his painting \"Uprising of Montenegrins\", which he painted in Vienna in 1862.

He tried to create a completely new form of Serbian education in Banat. His success can be seen by the fact that there were 66 elementary schools in Banat in 1768, and 117 new ones had been opened by 1776, with the majority of them established by Teodor Jankovi\u0107 Mirijevski. The education reform of the Serbs was only one of a series of reforms carried out in the 1770s, which had far-reaching consequences not only on the legal and political situation of the Serbs, but also on the development of their spiritual life. The reforms were implemented based on two Regulations (1770 and 1777), then the Declarations (1779) and the Consistory System (1782). One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the dissemination of respective books among the Serbs. \r\nThe reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Stefan Vujanovski (1743-1829) in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia and Avram Mrazovi\u0107 (1756-1826) in Ba\u010dka. They all had first completed courses held by Johann Ignaz Melchior von Felbiger (1724-1788) for primary school principals in Vienna. Teodor Jankovi\u0107 Mirijevski  published the first pedagogic schoolbook in Serbian language (1776). \r\n"

His father, Hariton, was born in Beodra (today Novo Milo\u0161evo, Serbia). He settled and lived in Vienna after the accomplishment of his Law Studies. He was the secretary of Baron Simon von Sina (1810-1876), one of the richest men of the Habsburg Empire. Djordje was baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt 13 (1010 Vienna), and his godfather was Baron Sina himself. After elementary school and after attending the Schottengymnasium in 1889, Joanovi\u0107 graduated in Medicine at the University of Vienna in 1895 with the title of Doctor of Medical Science. He remained on the same as assistant to Professor Richard Paltauf (1858-1924), then as Dozent from 1904, as Associate Professor from 1909, and as a Full Professor from 1919. In 1911 he was the editor of the scientific magazine \"Urania\" in Vienna. Since 1913 Joanovi\u0107 had been the Head of the Pathology Department at the Vienna Polyclinic. After the First World War he moved to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he was one of the founders of the Medical Faculty (where he taught Pathology from 1921) and the Pathology Institute in Belgrade. Joanovi\u0107 also founded the Yugoslav Society for the Study and Suppression of Cancer. In the field of Pathology he left more than 50 scientific papers, printed in German, French and Serbian. He was a member of numerous prestigious academic institutions in the country and abroad, including: a corresponding member of the Serbian Royal Academy, the President of the Serbian Medical Society, a honorary member of the Matica Srpska, a member of the German and Czech Oncology Committee, and the President of the fund for helping poor students. Dr. Djordje Joanovi\u0107 died on 28 January 1932 in Belgrade and was buried in Beodra (today Novo Milo\u0161evo, Serbia). The Institute of Pathology in Belgrade, the General Hospital in Zrenjanin as well as the Primary School in Novo Milo\u0161evo were named after him."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Petar Joki\u0107 became known in 1861, when he bought the Beethoven collection, two violins (Amari 1690, Guarneri 1718), one viola (Regeri 1690) and one cello (Guarneri 1712), and donated it to the Prussian Royal Library. The instruments were preserved in the so-called Jokits-Foundation (\"Jokits-Stiftung\"). As a reward the Prussian King Wilhelm I (1797-1888) honoured him in the same year with the Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class.  Until 1859, when he founded his own Company \"Peter Th. Jokits\", Petar Joki\u0107 worked for the Greek merchant Spirta. Joki\u0107 donated 300 florins for the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna in 1862.

As a boy he came to Belgrade, where he engaged in drawing and engraving. Due to his significant engravings he was recommended for a scholarship abroad. Upon his arrival in Vienna in 1838, as one of ten scholarship holders, he got to know the famous Greek banker Demeter Tirka (ca. 1802-1874), who became his patron. Since Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 did not possess the necessary knowledge for the Academy of Fine Arts (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\"), Demeter Tirka enrolled him in the Greek National School (\"Griechische Nationalschule\"). Demeter Tirka was the patron and godfather of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karadzi\u0107 (1787-1864) and the banker of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868). After the Greek National School, Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 started his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\"), which was then in the Monastery of St. Anna (\"Annakloster\"), where he studied until 1845. Having encountered at the Academy the basics of photography, he bought a Voigtl\u00e4nder camera in 1840. According to him, the camera costed about 100 forints and was the third camera of its kind. Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 welcomed Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (1780-1860), when he moved to Vienna in 1841. Since then he had been in friendly relations with the Prince, first as an interpreter, and in 1844 he became his secretary. In Vienna Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 had his own studio, where he made icons, but he also dealt with photography and lithography, and mostly with portrait photography. He left a rich artistic and photographic legacy, which is preserved today in the Museum of the City of Belgrade (\"Muzej Grada Beograda\"). As a man of confidence of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty he returned with Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 to Serbia in 1858, where he became the majordomo of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 in 1860. After the Prince's death in 1868, Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 withdrew from public life and stayed often in Vienna, where he had been a member of the Viennese Photographic Society since 1877. The Albertina Museum in Vienna preserves 12 of his photographs in its collections. Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 died in Belgrade in 1899."

After practising medicine in Sombor (today Serbia) and in Montenegro, Milan Jovanovi\u0107-Batut spent three years (from 1882 to 1885) on his specialisation in Munich, Berlin, Paris and London, where he met Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), Robert Koch (1843-1910) and Max Joseph von Pettenkofer (1818-1901). Milan Jovanovi\u0107-Batut was Rector of the High School in Belgrade (today the University of Belgrade). In 1919 he was one of the founders of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Belgrade and its first Dean. For more than 35 years Professor Jovanovi\u0107-Batut was the President of the Society of Serbian Physicians and the Society of Yugoslav Physicians. One of his most remarkable deeds was the founding of the Ministry of Public Health in 1919, thus making the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes one of the first countries in Europe to have such a Ministry. Milan Jovanovi\u0107-Batut met his wife Barbara Jaisl during his studies in Vienna. He died in Belgrade on 11 September 1940."

He was a friend of many prominent Serbs during their Viennese days (like Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski, Dr. Laza Lazarevi\u0107, Mina Vukomanovi\u0107, Simo Matavulj, Mihailo Polit Desan\u010di\u0107, Dr. Bogdan Medakovi\u0107, the Stova brothers, Dr. Vojislav Suboti\u0107, Prince Petar Karadjordjevi\u0107, Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107, Milo\u0161 Stratimirovi\u0107, and many others whom he mentioned in his diary). For many of them he was their house physician (like the families Adamovi\u0107, Despini\u0107 etc.). He had also meetings with his Austrian colleagues, like the Professors Jovan \u010cokor and Theodor Billroth. In his diary Jovanovi\u0107 described his daily activities: the names of the patients, how much they paid, with whom he met, and almost every evening where hedined. He mentioned a multitude of Viennese caf\u00e9s, restaurants and guest houses, e.g. the Caf\u00e9 Central, Zum roten Hahn, Griechenbeisl, Ertl, \u00d6sterreichischer Hof, Metropol, Garni Hotel, Hotel National, Hotel London, Caf\u00e9 Thury etc. He was often a guest in the so-called \"Slavonic Caf\u00e9\" (also \"Caf\u00e9 Gerlovich\"). His friend and fellow poet Laza Kosti\u0107 visited him very often in Vienna. Jovanovi\u0107 was also a friend of the Montenegrin Nikola I. Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 (1841-1921), whom Jovanovi\u0107 always met in Vienna, and Jovanovi\u0107 was even in the Prince's delegation in Moscow in 1883. Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj lived and worked from 23 October 1882 until 11 May 1887 in Porzellangasse 56 (1090 Vienna). He died in Sremska Kamenica (today Serbia) on 14 June 1904."

He was born in Belgrade in 1849 and since the same year he lived with his father in Vienna. Like his father he continued the good relations with the Viennese Greeks, especially with the famous Tirka family. After attending grammar school in Vienna, he studied Architecture in Zurich. Then, Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107 moved to Vienna, where he opened an office in 1880. He married Anna Marghareta Glass in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 7 July 1883. In this time he lived in Weintraubengasse 7 (1020 Vienna, still exists). Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107 was an associate of his Professor Gotfried Semper (1803-1879). Apart from buildings in Bulgaria, most of his projects can be found in Serbia. The most prominent building designed by Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107 was the building of the Serbian National Bank in Belgrade (still exists). From 1884 untill 1888 he lived in Ulrichgasse 1 (1020 Vienna, does not exist).  From 1888 until 1907 his address was Untere Donaustra\u00dfe 35 (1020 Vienna, does not exist). He published in Vienna amongst others \"Forschungen \u00fcber den Bau der Peterskirche zu Rom\" (Braum\u00fcller, 1877) and \"Zu den Streitfragen in der Baugeschichte der Peterskirche zu Rom: eine Erwiderung an Herrn Rudolf Redtenbacher\" (Braum\u00fcller, 1878).

              "value": "Pavle Paja Jovanovi\u0107 (1859-1957) was one of the most famous Serbian painters. His painting \"Bashibozuk\" was sold at an auction at Sotheby's in London in April 2018 for \u00a3 465,000. This was the most expensive painting of a Serbian painter to be sold worldwide. Pavle Jovanovi\u0107 studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (\"Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste\") from 1877 to 1884, where he received several awards and scholarships. In 1882 he was awarded the first prize in the Academy's annual exhibition and an imperial scholarship for the painting \"Wounded Montenegrin\". The public and many art critics turned their attention to the young painter, and in 1883 he signed a contract with a gallery in London. Jovanovi\u0107 then travelled through the Caucasus, Morocco, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain. After spending time in Paris and Munich, Pavle Jovanovi\u0107 stayed in Vienna, where he had his studio at Mariahilferstra\u00dfe 3 (1060 Vienna). In 1899 he received the Reichel Artist Award at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for his work \"Furor Teutonicus\". For the World Fair in Paris in 1900 he painted a great historical composition \"The Proclamation of Du\u0161an's Law\", for which he received the Golden Award. Since 1905 he almost exclusively painted portraits. He has portrayed almost all famous Serbian scientists, composers and members of the Karadjordjevi\u0107 dynasty. Pavle Jovanovi\u0107 has painted more than ten portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). The Emperor's valet Eugen Ketterl describes in his memoirs that Pavle Jovanovi\u0107 was the best painter of the Emperor's portraits. Ketterl writes: \"Unter den Kaiserbildern ragen die von Jovanovic geschaffenen \u00d6lgem\u00e4lde durch k\u00fcnstlerische Vollendung und \u00c4hnlichkeit hervor. (...) Da der Kaiser wenig Zeit zum Sitzen hatte, stellte der K\u00fcnstler einmal ein Portr\u00e4t in blo\u00df zwei Stunden fertig. Es war f\u00fcr den Dampfer \"Franz Josef I.\" der Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft bestimmt, der gelegentlich der Er\u00f6ffnung der Donaufahrtrinne bei Orsova eingeweiht wurde. Der Dampfer hatte einen wundervollen Speisesaal, der durch verschiebbare W\u00e4nde in zwei weitere R\u00e4ume - Schlafzimmer und Arbeitskabinett des Kaisers - abgeteilt werden konnte. Das Gem\u00e4lde geh\u00f6rt zu den besten, die vom Monarchen existieren. Es stellt ihn in Kampagneuniform (blauem Waffenrock) dar und ist so sprechend \u00e4hnlich und naturgetreu, da\u00df man vermeint, den Kaiser aus dem Rahmen heraustreten zu sehen.\" (Eugen Ketterl, Der alte Kaiser wie nur Einer ihn sah. Der wahrheutsgetreue Bericht des Leibkammerdieners Kaiser Franz Josephs I. Mit 23 Abbildungen. Wien et al. 1980, p. 123) He spent the period between the two World Wars mostly in Belgrade and Vienna. At the end of the 1930s he returned to Belgrade, where he remained until 1946. Pavle Jovanovi\u0107 then moved back to Vienna, where he died in Laudongasse 67 (1080 Vienna) on 30 November 1957."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Spiridon Jovi\u0107 (1801-1836) came to Vienna in 1826 in order to continue his education and from 1830 he was working as a trainee in the K.K. Hofkriegs-Buchhaltung. On 14 May and 24 October 1834 he sent two appeals to the Viennese police (K.K. Polizei- und Censur-Hofstelle ) in order to allow him to publish a Serbian newspaper entitled \"Narodni srbski list\" (\"Serbisches Volksblatt\") on a weekly basis. On 15 January 1836 he repeated his appeal, but this time he wanted to call his newspaper \"Ote\u010destvo\" (\"Fatherland\"). These newspapers should have been printed two times a week, for which the Viennese newspaper \"Wanderer\" served as a model. All these appeals were without success and the Viennese police put them ad acta on 30 June 1836 after Jovi\u0107's death. Spiridon Jovi\u0107 was the editor and publisher of the yearly almanac \"Srbska zora\" in 1836. He prepared also a second issue, which was published by his friend Grigorije Gruji\u0107 after Jovi\u0107's death in 1837. In the first issue, among various other contents, Spiridon Jovi\u0107 published the first translation of Shakespeare in Serbian language and also his poem \"Spomen\". In the issue of 1837 was printed Gruji\u0107's obituary on Jovi\u0107 and two of Jovi\u0107's short stories, namely \"Milutin\" and \"Nevera se sama kazni\" as well as his poem \"Pozdrav srbskim devicama\". Spiridon Jovi\u0107 wrote many works and pieces of literature in German language. In 1834 and 1835 he published articles for two Viennese newspapers \"Feierstunden\" and \"Der \u00d6sterreichische Zuschauer\". His articles were very often of ethnographic content, but there were also a few short stories. His most valuable work was \"Ethnographisches Gem\u00e4lde der slavonischen Milit\u00e4rgrenze\", published in Vienna in 1835. It was printed in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna) and financed by the author himself. This book contains a detailed description of the life of the Serbian population at the Habsburg Military Frontier. Some chapters were published later as newspaper articles. The book was dedicated to Carl Ritter von Pidoll zu Quintenbach, who was Hofrat and was serving as official at the Military Frontier. Spiridon Jovi\u0107 died on 16 June 1836 in his apartment \"In der Stadt 924\". The today's address is Weihburggasse 10 (1010 Vienna). The building was demolished in 1911. He was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) on 18 June 1836."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Nikola Kapamad\u017eija was born on 22 February 1851 in Pan\u010devo (today Serbia) and was married to Marie since 23 May 1885. He was the owner of the house in Millergasse 43 (1060 Vienna; the building does not exist anymore) together with his wife Marie. They bought this house in 1900. In the same year they purchased the house in B\u00fcrgerspitalgasse 30 (1060 Vienna). Nikola Kapamad\u017eija was also a member of the association of houseowners in the sixth Viennese disctrict. In this building he founded a commercial school (\"Handelsschule\"), himself being the director. Apart from the school there was also a dorm for the students. In 1900 he was honored with the Serbian St. Sava Order. The school was renamed after 30 years in 1911, and since then it was known as \"Mariahilfer Handelsschule\". Members of the school  board were amongst others Dr. M. Jakovljevi\u0107 and Marie Kapamad\u017eija. \r\nNikola Kapamad\u017eija was the owner and editor of the journal \"Mlada Srbadija\". The journal was published only for a short period of time starting from January 1876. The first issue on 1 January 1876 showed a picture of Svetozar Mileti\u0107, the political leader of the Serbs in the region of Vojvodina. The content was rich and manifold, e.g. texts by Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski and Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a, poems and biographies. The journal was planned to be published three times a month and printed in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna). Only three issues were printed, all of them in January 1876. Nikola Kapamad\u017eija died in his house at the age of 57 on 24 January 1908 and was buried in the Serbian part 68B of the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna)."

Following the first rule of Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 and Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1815-1842) Aleksandar Karadjordjevi\u0107 was the ruling Prince of Serbia from the 1842 to 1858. During his reign the reform and modernisation of the Serbian state was accomplished: the foundation of new schools, the Code of Civil Rights (1844), the foundation of the National Library and the National Museum etc. In December 1858, after a disagreement with his Ministers, the National Assembly forced him to abdicate and at the same time Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 was elected to be Prince of Serbia.\r\nAleksandar Karadjordjevi\u0107 lived in Vienna between 1871 and 1875, when he moved to Timi\u0219oara (today Romania). He lived there until the rest of his life and died on 3 May 1885. He was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) on 8 May 1885 in his uniform with all his decorations next to his wife Princess Persida.  The memorial service was held by Bishop Djordje Brankovi\u0107 and 17 other clergymen in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna). From the church to the cemetery two carriages with flowers, the prince's horse with a black robe, a carriage with the prince's body and his crown, sword and decorations were leading the solemn procession."

He was married to Sarka Anastasijevi\u0107 (1832-1931), the daughter of one of the richest Serbs in the 19th century, Mi\u0161a Anastasijevi\u0107. Prince Djordje Karadjordjevi\u0107 died in the spa town of Bad Gastein in Austria on 4 August 1884. He was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna)."

After his father's (Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevi\u0107) abdication in 1858 he spent 45 years in exile. He moved from Switzerland to France, where he graduated at the renowned Military Academy of Saint-Cyr (\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr) in 1864. During the war between France and Prussia in the years 1870/71 he fought in the French Foreign Legion. He was one of the leaders against the Ottomans in Herzegovina in 1875. Petar Karadjordjevi\u0107 joined the uprising under the name Petar Mrkonji\u0107. Later he lived in exile in Montenegro, where he married Zorka (1864-1890), the daughter of the Montenegrin Prince Nikola Petrovi\u0107 (1841-1921). After May 1903, when King Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 (1876-1903), the last ruler from the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty, was mudered in Belgrade, Petar Karadjordjevi\u0107 was elected to King of Serbia. He was ruling during the two Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and the First World War (1914-1918). Although a monarch, he was a strong supporter of Parliamentarism, Liberalism and Democracy. His reign was seen as the \"golden time of Serbian democracy\". Petar Karadjordjevi\u0107 was a follower of John Stuart Mill's ideas of Utilitarianism, freedom of speech, freedom of press etc. He translated Mill's work \"On Liberty\" into Serbian in 1867, and it was printed in Vienna in 1868."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) was a Serbian philologist and linguist and greatest reformer of the Serbian language. He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107, Dimitrije Fru\u0161i\u0107 and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled \"Pesnarica\" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book \"Pismenica\"  (\"Pismenica serbskoga jezika\"), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled \"Kleine serbische Grammatik\"). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated \"Hasanaginica\", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal \"\u00dcber Kunst und Alterthum\", the first one was \"Dioba Jak\u0161i\u0107a\" (\"Erbschaftsteilung\"). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (\"Proston\u00e1rodn\u00ed srbsk\u00e1 muza, do Cech p\u0159eveden\u00e1\", 1817), English (\"Servian popular poetry\", 1827), Swedish (\"Serbiska folks\u00e4nger\", 1830), Hungarian (\"Szerb n\u00e9pdalok h\u0151sreg\u00e9k\", 1836) and into Polish (\"Narodowe piesni serbskie\", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the \"Serbian revolution\" in 1828.\r\nVuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: \"Write as you speak, and read as it is written\". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.\r\nVuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstra\u00dfer Hauptstra\u00dfe 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883). \r\nVuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 and Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107, Petar Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161, Djura Dani\u010di\u0107, Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107, Anastas Jovanovi\u0107, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd (1753-1829), Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called \"Slavonic Caf\u00e9\" (also \"Caf\u00e9 Gerlovich\"), also \"Zum Weissen Wolfen\" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna. \r\nIn 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovi\u010d (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled \"Srpske Narodne pjesme\". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.\r\nVuk died in his appartment, where he spent his last 15 years of life, in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) on 7 February 1864. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His mortal remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897, while the tombstone still stands in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery.

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

She was born in Landstra\u00dfe 291 (today 66, 1030 Vienna) on 12 July 1828 and was baptised in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstra\u00dfer Hauptstra\u00dfe 54-56, 1030 Vienna). Her godfather was Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, her father\u2019s benefactor and private banker of the Obrenovi\u0107 Dynasty. \r\nMina was a secretary to her father and accompanied him on his journeys. She was very active in Vienna's social events and is described as a very educated and beautiful girl, who maintained contacts with numerous writers and artists. She spoke with her mother in German and with her father in Serbian. In addition to her bilingualism, she also learned Italian, French and English. She played piano and painted (over 50 paintings are preserved). In addition to the translation of Vuk's poems into German, which Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) praised, Mina also worked on the translation of the work of the publisher Ludwig August Frankl Ritter von Hochwart (1810-1894) entitled \"Gusle, der Freund des Hauses\" (Vienna 1852). Mina wrote to her brother Dimitrije in 1848 that she goes to Belvedere park and paints there five to six hours a day and three times a week. In 1858 she married Professor Aleksa Vukomanovi\u0107 (1826-1859) from Belgrade and converted to Orthodoxy. After his death in 1859 she moved to Vienna with their son Janko. In Vienna Mina looked after her parents. Vuk died in 1864 and Anna on 11 August 1876 in Beatrixgasse 16a (1030 Vienna). Mina died in the same house on 12 June 1894."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was raised to Hungarian nobility and became owner of the landed property German in the County of Timi\u0219oara (today Romania). Therefore, he acquired the epithet \"de German\". He died in German on 27 November 1828. Stefan Konstantinovi\u0107 de German was the owner of houses in Vienna with the numbers 699 (Grashofgasse 4, 1010 Vienna) and 704 (Fleischmarkt 9, 1010 Vienna). His first address was \"am alten Fleischmarkt im goldenen B\u00e4ren 741\". In this house died his son Nikola at the age of 3 on 1 May 1806. Nikola was buried on 3 May 1806 in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His daughter died in the same house on 8 January 1809 during childbirth and was buried on 10 January 1809 in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). Stefan's wife Jefimija, who was born in Novi Sad (today Serbia) in the family Petrovi\u0107, died just two days later at the age of 30 on 10 January 1809 and was also buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) on 12 January 1809. In the same house died Stefan's daughter Jelisaveta (1807-25 June 1812) and was also buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). In the house \"am alten Fleischmarkt 736\" died Stefan's daughter Maria on 18 January 1814. She was only 11 months old."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s.

After the graduation of Law Studies at the University of Pest, he received his doctoral title in 1866. Laza Kosti\u0107 was an associate of Svetozar Mileti\u0107 (1826-1901), the political leader of the Serbs in the region of Vojvodina. Laza Kosti\u0107 was a deputy in the Hungarian Parliament and also at the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). During his visits to Vienna in the 1880s he stayed at the home of his friend Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj (1833-1904). As Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 wrote in his diary, they were often together at the restaurant \"Griechenbeisl\" (Fleischmarkt 11, 1010 Vienna). Laza Kosti\u0107 died in the Cottagesanatorium (Sternwartestra\u00dfe 74, 1180 Vienna) on 9 December 1910. He stayed there from the beginning of November 1910, and his last days were described by Dr. Milan \u0160evi\u0107. On this very building the Matica Srpska placed a commemorative plaque in 1960."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

After the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778/1779) Freiherr von Loudon lived quietly at Hadersdorf (today part of 1140 Vienna). The reverses of other Austrian generals in the Ottoman War (1787-1792) called him for the last time into the field. Though of old age, he was commander-in-chief and won a last brilliant success by capturing Belgrade on 8 October 1789. He died on 14 July 1790 and was buried in the grounds of his estate in Hadersdorf. In the vicinity of his funerary monument are to be found the so-called \"T\u00fcrkensteine\", Ottoman stone sculptures, which were brought by his command from the fortress of Belgrade to his estate in Hadersdorf."

Because of his braveness and merits he was ennobled becoming a Baron and received the title \"von Trebinya\" on 26 January 1760. Two years later, on 30 April 1762, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Maria Theresia Order. Jeftimije Ljubibrati\u0107 was promoted to the rank of Major General in 1770 and to Field marshal-lieutenant in 1773.

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time.

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was the first Serb in the Habsburg Army, who reached the rank of General in 1763. He was ennobled to Baron on 28 June 1760 with the title \"von Schlangenfeld\". Mihailo Mika\u0161inovi\u0107 was promoted to the rank of Field marshal-lieutenant two years later (1765). He fought in the War of the Austrian Succession (\"\u00d6sterreichischer Erbfolgekrieg\", 1740-1748) and in the Seven Years War (\"Siebenj\u00e4hriger Krieg\", 1756-1763). He was also a deputy at the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) in 1769. Mihailo Mika\u0161inovi\u0107 was a benefactor of many Serbian churches and monasteries, to which he gave substantial donations. In his memoirs Dositej Obradovi\u0107 (1739-1811) mentioned his friendship with General Mika\u0161inovi\u0107, calling him \"our national hero\". In 1771 Mihailo Mika\u0161inovi\u0107 retired from military service. In 1774 he fell ill and moved to Vienna for medical treatment. Here he died on 5 November 1775."

              "value": "Milutin Milankovi\u0107 (1879-1958) was born on 28 May 1879 in Dalj near Osijek (today Croatia), in what was then Austria-Hungary. He was a Serbian mathematician and geophysicist, who studied civil engineering at the then College of Technology (\"Technische Hochschule\") in Vienna (now TU Vienna) and received his PhD there in 1904. This led to a successful, but short career as a technician. Milutin Milankovi\u0107 worked on major construction projects in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Among other things, he also designed the reinforced concrete ceilings for the Karlstrakt of the main building of the Technical University in Vienna. During this time, he developed and patented new approaches to concrete construction. In 1909 Milutin Milankovi\u0107 left Vienna and accepted a Professorship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Belgrade. This marked a turning point in his life. In addition to dealing with engineering-technical concrete construction problems, he turned increasingly to basic astronomical-mathematical research, especially on questions of the development of the Earth's climate. He achieved great fame with the calculation of the Milankovi\u0107 cycles concerning the seasonal variations of solar radiation and their effects on the climate, the validity of which has long been very controversial.\r\nMilutin Milankovi\u0107 contributed with three fundamental achievements to science: astronomical theories of climate change, theories of the movement of the Earth's poles and a revised Julian Calendar. Milankovi\u0107's revised Julian Calendar (1923) is astronomically the most accurate calendar so far (corresponding to the date of the Gregorian Calendar), which would need correction only after the year 28,800.\r\nAfter the scientific verifications of Milankovi\u0107's theories and results he received international acknowledgment by the World's scientific community (also posthumous):\r\nIn 1970 on the XIV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in the Brighton one crater on the Moon (measure 34 km; coordinates + 170, +77) recieved the Milankovi\u0107's name. In 1973 on the XV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in Sydney one crater on the Mars (measure 118 km, coordinates + 147, + 55) was also named after Milankovi\u0107. In 1980 the Asteroid 1605 (marks 1936GA), which had been discovered by the Serbian astronomers Milorad Proti\u0107 and Petar \u0106urkovi\u0107, received Milankovi\u0107's name. In 1993 the European Geosciences Union established the Milutin Milankovi\u0107 Medal as a prize for the acknowledgment to scientists for extraordinary research reports in the field long-term climate changes. It is awarded to scientists for their outstanding research in long-term climatic changes and modelling. \r\nMilutin Milankovi\u0107 was elected a Corresponding Member of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1920 and a Full Member in 1924, a Corresponding Member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb in 1925 and a Member of the German Academy of Naturalists \"Leopoldine\" in Halle. He was also a member of many scientific societies and related organisations, both in Yugoslavia and abroad. He died on 12 December 1958 in Belgrade and was buried by his request in his family tomb in his hometown Dalj."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

From 1851 to 1863 he attended ecclesiastical grammar schools in \u0160ibenik, Dubrovnik and Zadar. Nikodim Mila\u0161 studied Theology at the seminary in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) from 1863 to 1866. In the winter of 1866/67 he was a student at the University of Vienna for a short period of time. Already in 1867 Nikodim Mila\u0161 left Vienna for Kiev in the Russian Empire in order to study Canon Law at the Clerical Academy. From 1871 to 1890 he was teaching Canon Law and Theology at the seminary in Zadar, first as a Professor and later as Rector. On Christmas 1873 he became a monk of the Monastery of Dragovi\u0107 near Knin (today Croatia) receiving the name of Nikodim (1873 deacon, 1875 priest, 1880 Archimandrite). Nikodim Mila\u0161 was elected Orthodox Bishop of Dalmatia and Istria in 1890 and enthroned in Zadar on 7 October of the same year. He retired in 1912 and settled in Dubrovnik (today Croatia), where he spent his time doing research and writing scholarly works. Nikodim Mila\u0161 died on 2 April 1915 and was buried in the Orthodox cemetery of Dubrovnik. On 5 October 1930 his mortal remains were transferred to \u0160ibenik."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In 1865 he married Baroness Elisabeth von Reichlin Meldegg in Timi\u0219oara (today Romania). After his retirement he lived in Vienna and worked in the k.k. Milit\u00e4rgeographisches Institut. In 1902 Stefan von Milenkovi\u0107 received the Bauernfeldpreis and from 1909 he had a lifelong pension from the Schillerstiftung in Weimar.

Stefan von Milenkovi\u0107 corresponded with the Serbian writer Laza Kosti\u0107 (1841-1910), who helped Milenkovi\u0107 with the translation of the poem \"Moru\" (\"To the Sea\") of the Montenegrin Prince Nikola Petrovi\u0107 (1841-1921).

After his mother's death he left Sarajevo and lived in Venice, Leipzig and about 1775 he settled in Vienna. Here Jovan Mileti\u0107 had many friends, e.g. Maksim Kurtovi\u0107 (1731-1799), and also cousins, here the officer Miloradovi\u0107. He was already wealthy, and his property in Vienna also grew thanks to his countrymen, who sent him all kind of goods, which Jovan Mileti\u0107 sold in Vienna. About his wealth and his last will the scholar Marco Dogo writes: \"He left a fair sum to his family in his will, smaller sums to the monasteries of the Metropolis of Carlowitz (i.e. Sremski Karlovci), to the Serbian monastery on Mount Athos and to Christ's tomb in Jerusalem, a thousand florins to the Orthodox Church of Sarajevo and a further thousand florins to Sarajevo's poor people and orphans, and also 24,000 florins to the Serbian community of Trieste, the annual interest of which was to be used to pay for educating children. It was a considerable sum, if one thinks that at the time a teacher's yearly wage was about 300-400 florins, ....\" Jovan Mileti\u0107 died on 7 September 1790 in house No. 758 (Lugeck 2, 1010 Vienna), which does not exist anymore. He was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna)."

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Mihajlo Mi\u0161i\u0107 was Serbian Orthodox priest in Kraljevac (today Croatia). When the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava in Vienna had erected its Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna), he applied for the position of the Community's first priest. He was one of altogether 28 candidates for this very position. Although he was chosen for this duty, he could not be appointed to this position at first due to his Hungarian citizenship. Thanks to the intervention of Bishop Nikodim Mila\u0161 (1845-1915) of Dalmatia he was finally officially appointed in 1896. Until the outbreak of the First World War (1914) Mihajlo Mi\u0161i\u0107 was an integral part of the vivid religious and cultural life of the Serbian Orthodox Community. During the years of hardship in the war itself he was indefatigably supporting and helping his flock as well as Serbian prisoners of war in Austria-Hungary. He died on 11 December 1924 in Rudolfsspital (Boerhaavegasse 8, 1030 Vienna) and was buried four days later in the Serbian part 68B of the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna). His widow, Vukosava, published a vivid testimony on the foundation, history and religious as well as cultural life of the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava entitled \"Postanak i razvitak Srpske Svetosavske Crkve u Be\u010du\" (Beograd 1929)."

The son of an Orthodox priest attended courses of Johann Ignaz Melchior von Felbiger (1724-1788) for primary school principals in 1776/77 in Vienna. He was appointed by Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) to royal director of the Serbian Normal Schools in the district of Ba\u010dka and Baranja in 1778. In 1791 Avram Mrazovi\u0107 obtained Hungarian nobility and at the same time the title of a judge (\"Gerichtstafel-Beisitzer\") of the \"Bacser\" and \"Syrmier Comitat\". From 1778 to 1791 Serbian primary schools were opened in 74 settlements by Avram Mrazovic in the Pe\u010duj school district. The reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Teodor Jankovi\u0107 Mirijevski (1741-1814) in Banat and by Stefan Vujanovski (1743-1829) in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia. They all had first completed courses held by Felbiger for primary school principals in Vienna. In order to have sufficient teachers in his field, Avram Mrazovi\u0107 founded the first Serbian teacher institution, the so-called \"Norma\", on 1 May 1778 in Sombor (today Serbia). After the foundation of \"Norma\" he wrote several manuscripts for the needs of the pupils of this school and for the subjects he taught. In the late 1780s Avram Mrazovi\u0107 started his publishing activity. He published the almanac of the French writer Jeanne Marie Leprince de Beaumont (n\u00e9 Vaimboult, 1711-1780) entitled \"Magasin des enfans, ou Dialogues d'une sage gouvernante avec ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves\" in Serbian translation (\"Pou\u010ditelnij magazin za djecu\") in four volumes (first volume Vienna, 1787; second volume Vienna, 1793, third and fourth volume Budim, 1800). During the 1790s Avram Mrazovi\u0107 wrote and published three textbooks, namely \"\u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0443\" (Vienna, 1792), \"\u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0446\u0458\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0458\" (Vienna, 1794) and \"\u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0458\u0435\u0458 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0458\u0435\" (Vienna, 1794).

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Sava Mrkalj (1783-1833) was a Serbian philologist, poet, teacher and monk. He was born in Sjeni\u010dak (Military Frontier, today Croatia) in 1783 and educated in Pla\u0161ki and Zagreb. After that he studied Philosophy and Mathematics in Pest from 1807 to 1810, where he met Dimitrije Davidovi\u0107 (1789-1838) and Dimitrije Fru\u0161i\u0107 (1790-1838). His first meeting with Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) was also in Pest in 1810. This year was the most important in Mrkalj's life, because he published his main work entitled \"\u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0458\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0430\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0441\". In this short work (only 18 pages) he presented his ideas on the reform of the Serbian language. Sava Mrkalj, a remarkable polyglot, was already familiar with the works of John Lock (1632-1704) and especially of Johann Christoph Adelung (1732-1806). Mrkalj's credo was \"Write as you speak and read, as it is written\". Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 created his reform of the Serbian orthography having Mrkalj's work as a model. Sava Mrkalj became a monk in 1811. Later he lived as a teacher with many difficulties. He fell ill and after a few years in Karlovac (today Croatia) he was sent to the psychiatry in Vienna (\"Narrenturm\") in 1829. In his last days he was visited by Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u0107i\u0107 who brought him books. Sava Mrkalj died in the aforesaid psychiatry on 24 August 1833. His place of burial is unknown. In the year 2016 a commemorative plaque was put on the front of the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna) on the initiative of two scholars from the field of Slavonic Studies, Gordana Ili\u0107-Markovi\u0107 and Du\u0161an Ivani\u0107."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Jovan Mu\u0161katirovi\u0107 was a rationalist and critic of church institutions. He was the first to document folk traditions among Orthodox Serbs.

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was married to Gr\u00e4fin Marianne Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1854-1938) from 1877 until 1880. An interesting episode occurred on 22 March 1876, when Baron Mihajlo Nikoli\u0107 de Rudna paid a fine of 10 florins, because of driving too fast with his carriage through K\u00e4rntnerstra\u00dfe (1010 Vienna). In February 1882 he bought the house in Hegelgasse 8 (1010 Vienna) for 410,000 florins. Mihajlo Nikoli\u0107 de Rudna was the owner of the building in Belvederegasse 6-8 (1040 Vienna) from 1896. He adopted Johann Thierfelder (1884-?) in 1905 and gave him the epithet \"von Obrenow\" as a reminiscence that the family of Nikoli\u0107 was a descendant of Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (1780-1860). He was also landowner in Banat with 4,630 acres. Baron Mihajlo Nikoli\u0107 de Rudna died in Vienna in Sanatorium L\u00f6w on 21 November 1916."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In 1792 he bought a printing house from Josef von Kurzb\u00f6ck (1736-1792) and became a privileged imperial Cyrillic printer in the Habsburg Empire. He sold the printing house to Pest University in 1795 and returned to Osijek. There he worked at the court in the Counties of Ba\u010dka and Virovitica. He wrote anonymously the \"Dissertatio brevis ac sincera Hungari Auctoris de Gente Serbica perperam Rasciana dicta ejusque Meritis ac fatis in Hungaria cum Appendice Privilegiorum\" (sine loco, 1790) and in German \"Kurzgefasste Abhandlung \u00fcber die Verdienste und Schicksale der serbischen oder rascischen Nation in Hungarn, mit einem Anhange der derselben verliehenen Privilegien\" (Neusatz und Belgrad bei Jankovi\u0107 1791).

              "value": "Dimitrije Dositej Obradovi\u0107 (1739-1811) was a Serbian educator and reformer in the revolutionary period of national awakening, revival and the Enlightenment. He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradovi\u0107 was born in Ciacova near Timi\u0219oara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradovi\u0107 arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradovi\u0107 taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradovi\u0107 paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrovi\u0107 Sekere\u0161, the Baron and General Mihailo Mika\u0161inovi\u0107 (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Se\u010dujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mika\u0161inovi\u0107 he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanovi\u0107. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradovi\u0107 describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Sch\u00f6nbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradovi\u0107 left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled \"\u041f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0425\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0458\u0443\" (\"A Letter to Haralampije\") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtovi\u0107 (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradovi\u0107 gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradovi\u0107 as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem \"\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043e \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435\" (\"Poem on the Salvation of Serbia\"). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the \"\u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435\" from 1793. Dositej Obradovi\u0107 stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

She was married to the Serbian Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868) from 1853 until they separated in 1865. However, they stayed formally in marriage because of the canon law.

              "value": "Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868) was born on 16 September 1823 in Kragujevac (today Serbia). He was Prince of Serbia from 1838 to 1842, and after his exile from 1860 to his assassination on 10 June 1868 in Belgrade. His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 died childless in 1868. He was succeeded by his cousin, Milan Obrenovi\u0107 (1854-1901), whose grandfather was Jevrem Obrenovi\u0107 (1790-1856), a brother of Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (1780-1860) and Prince Mihailo's uncle.  \r\nPrince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 lived in Vienna with some interruptions between 1843 and 1860. He was the friend and supporter of many Serbian poets and writers in Vienna, starting with Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864), on whose recommendation the Prince travelled through the German states and met Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) and Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), then Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 (1817-1899), Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 (1825-1882), Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 (1824-1853), etc. In July 1853 Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 returned to Vienna on the Prince's invitation to be a teacher of the Serbian language for the Princess Julie Obrenovi\u0107 (1831-1919). \r\nPrince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 was also best man and godfather of the family of Major General Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 (1822-1908) in Vienna. On 10 May 1854 the Prince was best man at the wedding of Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, and then he and later the Prince and King Milan Obrenovi\u0107 were godfathers of the Stratimirovi\u0107 children. There are also several compositions of famous Austrian composers, which were dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107: Johann Strauss Son op. 14 \"Serben Quadrille\" from 1846; Phillip Fahrbach Senior op. 151 \"Serben Polka\" from 1853  and Johann Dubez Op. 17 \"Divertissement sur des motifs de l'Op\u00e9ra: Ernani pour la Zither\". He married Countess Julie Hunyady de K\u00e9thely (1831-1919) in the Russian Orthodox chapel of the Russian Legation in Vienna on 1 August 1853. His best man was the Russian diplomat Peter von Meyendorff (1796-1863). The Austrian newspapers wrote that the Prince was dressed in national costume and had a sabre with diamonds worth 80,000 florins. On the other side the Princess wore a diamond diadem. They lived in the \"Obrenovic-Palais\" in Vienna and the Castle of \"Ivanka\" near Bratislava (Ivanka pri Dunaji, today Slovakia). They separated by a signed agreement on 18 November 1865. The house in Vienna (estimated to be worth 100,000 ducats) and also the Castle of \"Ivanka\" became a property of the Princess and she received a yearly allocation of 5,500 ducats."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was born in M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti (today Romania) on 22 August 1854. He succeeded his cousin Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868) in 1868. During his rule Serbia became an independent state after two Serbian-Ottoman Wars (1876-1878) and was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). His reign was also a period of modernisation. Milan Obrenovi\u0107 abdicated in 1889, and his 13 year old son Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 (1876-1903) became King. After the abdication Milan Obrenovi\u0107 lived in Paris and in 1897 returned to Serbia, where he was installed as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. After a disagreement regarding his son's wedding with Draga Ma\u0161in (1864-1903) he left Serbia. Milan Obrenovi\u0107 settled in Vienna. From autumn 1900 he lived firstly in the Hotel Imperial and then in an apartment in Johannesgasse 16 (1010 Vienna). Here died Milan Obrenovi\u0107 on 11 February 1901. He was a close friend of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916), who awarded to him the Grand Cross of the Austrian Imperial Order of Leopold (\"Gro\u00dfkreuz des Leopoldordens\") on 7 January 1870. The 97th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army (K\u00fcstenl\u00e4ndisch-krainerisches Infanterieregiment Nr. 97) was named after him in 1883 (until 1892). There are several compositions of Austrian composers, which were dedicated to King Milan Obrenovi\u0107: two compositions to King Milan and Queen Natalija by Philipp Fahrbach Junior (1884), the \"King Milan March\" by Anton Riedl (1885) and three songs by Carl Streitmann (1887)."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In 1768 Zaharije Orfelin also published the first Serbian newspaper entitled  \"Slaveno-serbski Magazin\" in Venice. In 1772 he published \"\u017ditije Petra Velikog\" (\"The Life of the Russian Tsar Peter the Great\"). In 1783 Zaharije Orfelin moved upon the recommendation of Metropolitan Mojsej Putnik to Vienna and started to work as a corrector in the printing house of Josef von Kurzb\u00f6ck (1736-1792). In this printing house he published two of his works, namely \"Iskusni podrumar\" and \"Ve\u010dni kalendar\" (both in 1783). For his work \"Kaligrafija\" he was awarded 100 ducats by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) in 1777. Zaharije Orfelin was a honorary member of the Viennese Academy of Arts from 1772. He was nominated as honorary member of the Schmutzer Engravers Academy before 1767, and with the unification of these two Academies he became a member of the Academy of Arts. Zaharije Orfelin died in Novi Sad (today Serbia) on 30 January 1785."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He is one of the greatest Southern Slavic poets and philosophers. His \"Mountain Wreath\" (\"Gorski vijenac\") is one of the best known and most popular masterpieces of Serbian and Montenegrin literature. In the period from 1833 to 1847 he stayed several times in Vienna, during which he met amongst others the famous Austrian statesman Prince Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich (1773-1859). Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 even wrote a poem in honour of the Prince and his wife in 1837. In 1833 Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 had already met Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864), and since then they had remained very close friends. Many important portraits of Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 were made in Vienna, one of them by Uro\u0161 Kne\u017eevi\u0107 (1811-1876) and one by Johannes Bes (both in 1847). Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 (1817-1899) also painted several portraits and made one photography of Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161. In 1842 Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 received a cross richly decorated with brilliants as personal gift by the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875). During his stay in Vienna in 1847, Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 lived in the guesthouse above the \"Caf\u00e9 Stierb\u00f6ck\" (Praterstra\u00dfe 6, 1020 Vienna). Here he wrote the final part of his aforesaid \"Mountain Wreath\" (\"Gorski vijenac\"), which was printed in the publishing house of the Mekhitarist Congregation in Vienna in the same year. Apart from this he also published his works \"Tri dana u Trijestu\" (1844) and \"Kula Djuri\u0161i\u0107a i \u010cardak Aleksi\u0107a\" (1850) in the same publishing house."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He studied Philosophy at the University of Vienna from 1852 and then Law from 1853, where he received the title of Dr of Law in 1861. After working in the Croatian Court Chancellery, he was elected as a deputy to the Croatian Parliament in 1861, where he stayed until 1868. Later, Mihajlo Polit Desan\u010di\u0107 worked as a lawyer in Novi Sad. From 1873 until 1913 he was a deputy to the Hungarian Parliament. He was the editor of the Serbian newspaper \"Branik\" from 1885 to 1914. According to his memoirs, Mihajlo Polit Desan\u010di\u0107 spent fourteen years in Vienna. He came to Vienna to finish the two last classes of grammar school by attending the Akademisches Gymnasium (1010 Vienna) in preparation for his studies in 1849. His private teacher at that time was Svetozar Mileti\u0107 (1826-1901). Later, Mihajlo Polit Desan\u010di\u0107 became a friend of Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 (1831-1865), Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 (1810-1863), Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj (1833-1904), Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 (1825-1882) and Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 (1824-1853) as well of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864). His Viennese Professor Lorenz von Stein (1815-1890) recommended him in 1856 as a journalist to the \"Deutsche Vierteljahres Schrift\", \"Unsere Zeit\" and \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" from Augsburg. For the next 40 years Mihajlo Polit Desan\u010di\u0107 wrote for these newspapers. His articles were mostly concerned with the Serbs people and the Balkan Peninsula, but also with the Eastern Crisis and the Ottoman Empire."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

She was an Austrian poet and writer of Serbian / Croatian origin (cf. on this issue the biography of her grandfather Petar von Preradovi\u0107). She became famous as the author of the Austrian National Anthem (\"Land der Berge\", 1947). Her parents Du\u0161an von Preradovi\u0107 (1854-1920), naval officer, and Helene, n\u00e9 Baronesse Falke von Lilienstein (1864-1953), married in the Votivkirche (1090 Vienna) on 15 December 1886. Du\u0161an's father was the famous poet and Major General Petar von Preradovi\u0107 (1818-1872). Paula Preradovi\u0107 maried the journalist and historian Dr. Ernst Molden (1886-1953), the founder of the Austrian newspaper \"Die Presse\" in 1946, on 3 April 1916 and they had two sons, Otto (1918-2002) and Friedrich (1924-2014). Together with her husband she was arrested by the Gestapo during the Second World War as an enemy of the Nazi Regime. She died on 25 May 1951 and was buried in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna). In the same tomb were buried her husband and her sons. Paula Preradovi\u0107's last apartment since 1924 was Osterleitengasse 7 (1190 Vienna). A commemorative plaque was put on this building on 31 December 1952. The Council Committee for Culture (\"Gemeinderatsausschu\u00df f\u00fcr Kultur\") of the City of Vienna named a street, Preradovicgasse, in the 14th  Viennese district after her on 2 June 1995.

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Next to this church were buried Preradovi\u0107's parents. However, Petar von Preradovi\u0107 himself converted later to Roman Catholicism and declared himself as a Croat. Therefore, we still encounter an ongoing discussion in Serbian and Croatian historiography on his identity. Petar von Preradovi\u0107 started his military education at the Theresian Military Academy (\"Theresianische Milit\u00e4rakademie\") in Wiener Neustadt from 1830 to 1838. He was ennobled in 1864 and was promoted to Major General in 1866. Petar von Preradovi\u0107 was also a poet, who was very popular at this time. He married twice: Pauline de Ponte (died on 4 May 1855) on 11 October 1848 and Emma Regen von Bleyleben on 17 April 1865. His granddaughter was Paula Preradovi\u0107 Molden (1887-1951), also poet and writer, and author of the text of the Austrian National Anthem (\"Land der Berge\"). Petar von Preradovi\u0107 lived in Ungargasse 39 (1030 Vienna) from 1870 to 1872. The Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (Jugoslavenska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti / JAZU) in Zagreb put on the front of the building in Ungargasse a commemorative plaque for Petar von Preradovi\u0107 in 1968. Petar von Preradovi\u0107 died in Fahrafeld (today Austria) on 18 August 1872 in the house Nr. 17 (today Hainfelderstra\u00dfe 66). He was buried three days later in the Viennese Matzleinsdorfer Cemetery (today Waldm\u00fcllerpark, 1100 Vienna). After the closing of this cemetery in 1874 Preradovi\u0107's remains were transferred to Zagreb to the Mirogoj Cemetery in 1879."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Despite the fact that he died at the age of 29 and that he wrote only around 60 poems, Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 was, apart from Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj (1833-1904) and Laza Kosti\u0107 (1841-1910), the most important poet of Romanticism in Serbian literature. After attending grammar school in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia), he studied first Law in Vienna from 1843 and then Medicine. He received financial support from Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868) during his studies. Therefore, the second volume of his poems was dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107, while the first one was devoted to the Serbian youth. Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 published his first two volumes of poems in the publishing house of the Mekhitarist Congregation in Vienna (\"Pesme I\" in 1847 and \"Pesme II\" in 1851). The third volume of his poems was published by his father posthumously in 1862. Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107's best friend was Djura Dani\u010di\u0107 (1825-1882). They were the most dedicated followers of the ideas and reforms of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864). Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 was seriously ill from tuberculosis and died on 1 July 1853 in Schl\u00f6sselgasse 12 (1080 Vienna). He was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His remains were transferred to the Stra\u017eilovo hill in the vicinity of Sremski Karlovci on 20 July 1883."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

The first settlers were merchants, who transported goods from the Ottoman to the Habsburg Empire and were thus granted freedom of trade by the Habsburg emperor Leopold I (1640-1705) in 1670. A larger number of Serbs most probably reached Vienna in connection with the second Ottoman siege of 1683. The siege lasted from 14 July to 12 September 1683. Since the garrison was cut off from the Austrian and Polish relieving force, scouts were needed for the exchange of letters and messages between the separated bodies of troops. At least one of them was a merchant of Serbian origin, namely Georg Thomas Michaelowitz. After the Ottoman defeat the Serbs most probably founded their own area of settlement outside the city walls called \"Ratzenstadel\" (\u201cRazen Stadtl\u201d), which derives from the Hungarian word for Serb (\u201cR\u00e1c\u201d) and the German deductions \"Raizen, Raitzen, Rascier\", which again points to the Serbian medieval region of \"Ra\u0161ka\" (also known today as Novi Pazar, Serbia). The \"Ratzenstadel\" lay in the sixth district (1060) of Vienna, which is today \"Mariahilf\".\r\n\"Im Volksmund wurde die Vorstadt das (!) Ratzenstadel genannt. Der Begriff d\u00fcrfte sich von den Serben oder Raizen ableiten, die dort ihre ersten Wohnst\u00e4tten in Wien hatten.\" Cf. https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Magdalenengrund_(Vorstadt)"

He was educated in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in Kiev. Jovan Raji\u0107 was one of the best educated Serbs of his time. He wrote in Serbian, Russian, Latin, German and Hungarian and published a Serbian catechesis for children, which was printed in Vienna in 1774. His most important work was his \"History of the Bulgarian, Serbian and Croatian Peoples\" (\"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0430\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440, \u0425\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\"), which was published in the printing house of Stefan Novakovi\u0107 in Vienna between 1794 and 1795. This history was one of the first written by a Serb and had an enormous influence on the subsequent generations of historians. Jovan Raji\u0107 collected sources in the Russian Empire and on the Holy Mount Athos. He also used parts of the manuscript of Count Djordje Brankovi\u0107 (1645-1711). Apart from its scholarly character, Jovan Raji\u0107's \"History\" was the first Serbian book, which was printed by subscription. Namely, the advertisement for the book was published in Novakovi\u0107's daily newspaper in Vienna, called \"Slaveno-Serbskija Vjedomosti\", in 1794 and the readers assembled the money for this book. Jovan Raji\u0107 died in the Monastery of Kovilj in 1801."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Petar Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107 (1824-1869) was born in Sarajevo (today Bosnia and Herzegovina) in 1824. He was a merchant of Ottoman goods in Vienna, especially those from Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 1855. He died on 13 September 1869 at the age of 45 in his apartment in Wollzeile 21 (1010 Vienna). He was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna) on 15 September 1869. In the same tomb was buried his eight year old daughter Vera on 25 December 1869, who was born in Vienna in 1861. She had also died in the apartment in Wollzeile 21 (1010 Vienna) on 21 December 1869. \r\nThe Company \"Haghi Risto's S\u00f6hne\" was founded in 25 July 1855 with its seat in Wollzeile 21 (1010 Vienna) by Petar Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107, Ottoman citizen, and Vasilije Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107 in Sarajevo. The Company was deleted from the commercial register in 1865, and Petar founded a new Company \"P. Haggi Risto\", which was registered on 23 September 1865. Its address was again Wollzeile 21. Since 15 July 1870, i.e. after the death of Petar Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107, the existence of a Company \"P. Haghi Risto & Cie.\" is attested at the same address. Its owners were Katarina and Risto Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107. At the same time the Company \"P. Haggi Risto\" was deleted from the commercial register. In 1883 the Company \"P. Haghi Risto & Cie.\" was moved to Grashofgasse 4 (1010 Vienna, the building does not exist anymore), and apart from Katarina Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107, its owners were Stefan and Konstantin Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107. \r\nSince 2 May 1908 the Company's owner was Dr. iur. Stephan Had\u017ei Risti\u0107 with its seat in Rauchensteingasse 3 (1010 Vienna). In 1928 the Company was in the process of liquidation. Konstantin Had\u017ei-Risti\u0107 died on 6 June 1928 in Hofgasse 9 (1050 Vienna, the building does not exist anymore). Finally, the Company was deleted from the commercial register in October 1931."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 was a member of the \"Matica Srpska\" and also a deputy at the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) in 1897. In politics he was associated with Svetozar Mileti\u0107 (1826-1901). Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 died in Novi Sad in 1908. \r\nIn 1857 he began to study Law and Slavonic Studies in Vienna, and graduated in both academic fields in 1861. He was a secretary of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) and since 1862 he was in the editorial office of the the political newspaper \"Ost und West\". Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 wrote articles in Aleksandar Andri\u0107's (1816-1876) \"Svetovid\" since 1857. After the arrest of the editor Imbro Tkalac (1824-1912) in 1863, Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 replaced him and stayed on this position until 1865. In 1865 Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 was sentenced to six months in prison because of his article \"Die Slaven \u00d6sterreichs\", which was published on 17 January 1865 in \"Ost und West\".  On 20 December 1864 the newspaper itself was abolished. Aleksandar Sandi\u0107 translated books about the Serbs in the Austrian Empire from German into Serbian, e.g. the book by Baron Johann Christoph Bartenstein \"Kratak izve\u0161taj o stanju rasejanoga mnogobrojnoga ilirskog naroda po carskim i kraljevskim nasledni\u010dkim zemljama\u201d(1866) and Felix Kanitz's \"Vizantiski spomenici po Srbiji\" (1862).

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was born in an officer's family on the Military Frontier. His father was Captain Djordje Se\u010dujac, who was awarded due to his military merits the noble title \"von Heldenfeld\" on 7 July 1759. Arsenije Se\u010dujac started his military career in 1741. On 30 April 1762 he received the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresia and in 1767 he was raised to the noble rank of Baron. In 1783 Arsenije Se\u010dujac was promoted to the rank of Major General and in the same year he retired and moved to Vienna. Arsenije Se\u010dujac was named Hofrat in the Illyrian Court Office (\"Illyrische Hofkanzlei\") in Vienna, where he worked until his death in 1814. According to Dositej Obradovi\u0107 (1739-1811) Arsenije Se\u010dujac helped the Serbs in Vienna very much. His doors were always open for every Serb, who had come to Vienna. Arsenije Se\u010dujac died on 13 January 1814 in his apartment Wollzeile 914 (today Wollzeile 14, 1010 Vienna) at the age of 94 and was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna)."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Since 1850 he studied in Vienna under the guidance of Professor Simon Sechter (1788-1867). In the years 1851 and 1852 he published the two volumes of his liturgical composition \"Liturgy\". Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 also released in Vienna one of his main works entitled \"Serbian Folk Songs\" (\"\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043c\u0435\", 1859, 1862, 1863) and  also three books on the Orthodox Church Chant of the Serbian People (\"\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0458\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0443 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u201c, 1862, 1863, 1864). Kornelije Stankovi\u0107's importance for the development in music among the Serbs is enormous. He belonged to the Serbian circle around Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) in Vienna, for whose collected folk songs he composed the respective music. The first appereance of Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 as a composer and conductor was most probably in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna). Apart from being friend with many prominent Viennese Serbs, Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 was also a good friend of the Russian Orthodox priest in Vienna, Mihail Fjodorovi\u010d Rajevski (1811-1884). On the feast of St. Sava (27 January) in 1859 Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 performed his \"Liturgy\" in the Russian Orthodox chapel of the Russian Legation in Vienna (Walfischgasse 5, 1010 Vienna). One of his most important Viennese concerts was a charity concert of spiritual music in the Viennese Musikverein (then in Tuchlauben 12, 1010 Vienna) on 1 April 1861. The entire revenue was given for the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna. Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 left Vienna in 1854 and lived in Belgrade in the years 1862 and 1863.

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was born in Crepaja (today Serbia) on 24 June 1821. Since 1839 he was in the Austrian Army, first in the 57th Infantry Regiment and later in the 47th, the 42nd, the 35th and the 73rd Infantry Regiment as well as in the 12th Border Regiment. He was one of the most important officers among the Serbian troops in the years 1848 and 1849, which were fighting for the Habsburg Dynasty against the Hungarian uprising. Due to his military merits on the battlefields against the Hungarians he was honored with the Knight's Cross of the Leopold Order and the Military Merit Cross. In 1853 Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 was ennobled with the title of Knight of Vilovo (Ritter von Vilovo) for his bravery in the battle of Vilovo in 1849 (to the East of Novi Sad). In 1864 he was promoted to the rank of Major. After his retirement Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski settled in Vienna and wrote several books and articles on hydrography. He was a member of the Viennese Hydrographic Society, the Viennese Scientist Club, the Danube and African Society. On the international geographic exhibition in Venice in 1886 Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski received a silver medal. He married Emilija (n\u00e9 Tamburi\u0107, 1836-1917), and they had four children: two sons and two daughters. They celebrated the 50th anniversary of their wedding (Golden Wedding) in Vienna on 21 October 1900. Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski was very popular and active among the Viennese Serbs, especially in the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava, whose President he was from 1870 to 1874.\r\nJovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski died in his apartment in Hintere Zollamtstra\u00dfe 3 (1030 Vienna) on 25 March 1902. He was buried two days later in the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) after a memorial service in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna. His wife Emilija died on 11 August 1917 in the \"Kaiser Jubil\u00e4ums Spital der Stadt Wien\" (today Krankenhaus Hietzing, Wolkersbergenstra\u00dfe 1, 1130 Vienna).  \r\n\r\nHis bibliography includes:\r\nErlebnisse eines k. k. \u00f6sterr. Off. in den Feldz\u00fcgen 1848 und 1849 in Ungarn, 1863 (in German and Serbian) \r\nDie Entsumpfung der Niederungen der Theiss und des Banats, 1874 \r\n\u00dcber die Ursachen der Katastrophe von Szegedin, 1879\r\nUngarns Stromregulierungen, 1883\r\nDie Entsumpfung und Regulierung des s\u00fcd\u00f6stl. niedrigsten Theiles Syrmiens, in: Danubius 18, 1902."

              "value": "Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski (1854-1921), the son of Jovan Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski (1821-1902) and Emilija (n\u00e9 Tamburi\u0107, 1836-1917), moved to Vienna with his parents in 1867, when he was 13 years old. He edited the newspapers \"Srbadija\" (1875-1877) and \"Srpska Zora\" (1876-1881) in Vienna, whose owner he was. Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski was a prominent figure among the Viennese Serbs. From 1875 to 1881 he was the President of the Serbian Students' Association \"Zora\". In 1879 he was named as deputy and secretary of the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski met his future wife Camilla von Ottenfeld in the building, where both families lived (Burggasse 24, 1080 Vienna). They married in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 5 February 1885. His best man was the Austrian and then Serbian General Djura Horvatovi\u0107 (1835-1895). Since 1887 Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski was a corresponding member of the Anthropological Society in Vienna. In 1881 he moved from Vienna to Belgrade, where he became the editor of the newspaper \"Videlo\" and director of the Serbian Press Bureau (1881-1887 and 1912-1915). Because of political issues he returned to Vienna in 1887, where he stayed until 1895. Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski was director of the Serbian Post and Telegraph until 1899, when he moved again to Vienna after a conflict with the Prime Minister Vladan Djordjevi\u0107 (1844-1930). This time he stayed in Vienna until 1909. He lived in Belgrade from 1909 to 1915, when he was arrested after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia and sent to Vienna.  He died on 9 January 1921. In his memoirs \"Iz moga \u017eivota\" he narrates important information, not only about his life in Vienna, but also about the Serbian community and the social life of the Serbs in Vienna. \r\nHere are some examples: Vilovski's grandfather, Djordje Tamburi\u0107, was a frequent guest at Mayreder's Serbian caf\u00e9, located in Rotenturmstra\u00dfe (1010 Vienna), until his death. He died in 1881 and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). As other meeting places of the Viennese Serbs Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski mentions the \"Mirakelkeller\" (Haarhof, Rotenturmstra\u00dfe 16, 1010 Vienna) and \"Zu den drei Raben\" (Rotenturmstra\u00dfe 21, 1010 Vienna). The friends and supporters of Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) gathered in the \"Slavonic Caf\u00e9\" (also \"Caf\u00e9 Gerlovich\") of \u0410ndrija Gerlovi\u0107 in Bauernmarkt (1010 Vienna) every afternoon.\r\nTodor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski met Felix Kanitz (1829-1904) in the house of Wilhelmine-Mina Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1828-1894) in 1869. Felix Kanitz was a faithful friend of Vuk's family for the rest of his life in recognition of Vuk's support for his scholarly work in Serbia. Based on Kanitz's recommendation, Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski became a correspondent on the Balkans and Serbian literature in the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung for the duration of ten years and also one of the authors of Baron Joseph Alexander von Helfert's (1820-1910) \"Die V\u00f6lker \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns\" (1880). The 11th volume of this series is entitled \"Die Serben in Dalmatien und im S\u00fcdlichen Ungarn, in Bosnien und im Herzegowina\" and was written by Todor Stefanovi\u0107 Vilovski. Vilovski's book \"Aus Belgrads Vergangenheit\" (Vienna, Druck und Verlag Adolf Holzhausen, 1894) is also of great significance, because the Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) himself in person took it for the Imperial Library (today the National Library of Austria in Vienna) and thanked the author."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time.

His role in the founding of this community in 1860 was crucial.  Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 led the delegation which was in audience to Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) on 13 December 1860. This delegation thanked the Emperor for his approval for the founding of the Serbian Orthodox Community of St. Sava. Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 studied Law in Pest (today Hungary), where he was promoted to Dr of Law in 1833. After that he worked as a lawyer and official in Pest and Timi\u0219oara (today Romania). He also took a part in the first Slavic Congress in Prague in 1848 and played an important role among the Serbs in the revolutionary years of 1848-1849 as well as in the establishment of the Serbian autonomous region (\"Vojvodstvo Srbija\"), which existed as a province of the Austrian Empire from 1849 to 1860.

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Petar Stojanovi\u0107 (1877-1957) was a Serbian violinist and composer. He was born in Budapest (today Hungary) on 25 August 1877. Petar Stojanovi\u0107 studied at the Viennese Conservatorium from 1899 to 1905. During his studies he received a state prize for his violin concert (\"Staatspreis f\u00fcr Sch\u00fcler der Kompositionsklassen an \u00f6sterreichischen Konservatorien und Musikschulen\") in 1904. In 1905 Petar Stojanovi\u0107 composed his opera \"Der Tiger\", which had its world premiere in the Opera of Budapest on 14 November 1905. The text for the opera had been written by the Director of the Viennese Conservatorium, Richard von Perger (1854-1911). Petar Stojanovi\u0107 lived in Vienna, where he composed several of his works, and he had several appearances in concerts. On 10 March 1910 the violinist Petar Stojanovi\u0107 held a concert together with the pianist Bertha Jahn-Beer (1883-1929) in the B\u00f6sendorfer-Saal (Palais Liechtenstein,Herrengasse 6-8, 1010 Vienna). He performed also with the famous Serbian opera singer and member of the Viennese Opera Nikola Zec (1883-1958) at the Academy of St. Sava in the Hotel Continental (Taborstra\u00dfe 2, 1020 Vienna) on 26 January 1925. Petar Stojanovi\u0107 composed the music for two operettas, which were on stage in the Viennese Carl Theater (Carltheater, Praterstra\u00dfe 31, 1020 Vienna), namely \"Liebchen vom Dach\" and \"Der Herzog von Reichstadt\". The operetta \"Liebchen vom Dach\" had its world premiere in the Carl Theater on 19 May 1917 and the operetta \"Der Herzog von Reichstadt\" on 11 February 1921. \"Der Herzog von Reichstadt\" was played more than 200 times in Vienna (until 1924). In 1912 Petar Stojanovi\u0107 had founded a private school for violin courses in Florianigasse 60 (1080 Vienna). He published also a handbook entitled \"Neue Elementar-Violinschule\" (Vienna, Ludwig Doblinger Verlag) in four volumes in 1914. He founded the Society of the Friends of Slavic Music (\"Gesellschaft der Freunde slawischer Musik\") in Vienna in 1925. Petar Stojanovi\u0107 married Henriette Stefanie Wilezynska from Vienna in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna on 2 February 1911. At this time Petar Stojanovi\u0107 lived in Lustkandlgasse 37(1090 Vienna). His son Aleksandar Jovan was born in Vienna on 30 October 1918 and was baptised in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava on 5 November. Petar Stojanovi\u0107 lived with his family at that time in Friedlgasse 45 (1190 Vienna). Since 1925 he lived in Belgrade, where he worked as a director of a music school. Petar Stojanovi\u0107 died in Belgrade on 11 September 1957."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Petar Stoji\u0107 collected money for the building of the Church of St. Sava among the Serbs in Banat, Ba\u010dka, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until April 1892 he and Aleksandar \u0160tova (1836-1898) had amassed more than 20,000 florins. Because of his merits in the building of the church he was declared Honorary President of the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava at its annual meeting in 1893. Together with Aleksandar \u0160tova he was also a member of the delegation which was in audience to Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) in November 1893. This delegation thanked the Emperor for his donation for the church building and also for his presence at the inauguration ceremony. Petar Stoji\u0107 retired as commander of the 4th Ulan Regiment in 1894, when he received the honorary rank of Major General."

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908) was a prominent Serbian army commander in the Vojvodina and a Major General in the Austrian Army. He was born in Novi Sad (today Serbia). His ancestor was Bogi\u0107 Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 von Stratimirovi\u0107, originally from Herzegovina, who fought on the side of the Habsburg Empire in the Austro-Ottoman War of 1737-1739. Due to his merits he received by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) the landed property of Kulpin as well as Hungarian nobility, together with his brothers Ivan, Toma and Nikola. \r\nDjordje Stratimirovi\u0107 attended the Viennese Engineering Academy from 1837 to 1841. He was the military leader of the Serbs, who were loyal to the Habsburg Dynasty in the revolution of 1848-1849, against the Hungarians. At an assembly in May 1848 he was elected president of the main committee of the Serbian people and provisional army chief. In October 1848 Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 left the command of the army to Stevan \u0160upljikac (1786-1848) and took on the task to go to to Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) in order to obtain the recognition of the decisions of the May Assembly. In Djordje 1849 Stratimirovi\u0107 re-entered the Austrian Army in the rank of colonel at the invitation of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg (1800-1852). Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 married Albine von Beck on 10 May 1854 in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna). They were married by the Bishop Platon Atanackovi\u0107 (1788-1867) of Novi Sad and  Stratimirovi\u0107's best man was Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868). After the church ceremony a wedding celebration was held at the Hotel \"Stadt London\". The godfathers of Stratimirovi\u0107's children were the Princes Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 and Milan Obrenovi\u0107 (1854-1901). \r\nIn 1859 Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 left the military service in the rank of Major General. After his military career he was engaged in diplomacy and politics. He fulfilled diplomatic missions in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Epirus and Corfu, and was Governor of Dalmatia and General Consul in Sicily. In the Hungarian Parliament (1865-1872) he led the Serbian conservatives in their fight against the political subjugation of the Serbs. In the autumn of 1877 Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 settled in Vienna, where he remained until the end of his life. \r\nHe wrote articles for many newspapers, namely \"Politik\", \"Wiener Tagblatt\", \"Vorstadtzeitung\", \"Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Vaterland\" and \"Trib\u00fcne\". Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 published his paper \"Ausgrabungen auf der Hochebene Glasinac im Jahre 1891. Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht. Mit 33 Abbildungen\" in the journal \"Wissenschaftliche Mitteilungen aus Bosnien und der Herzegowina\" in 1893 (volume 1, pages 113-125.). In 1896 King Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 (1876-1903) honored him with the Order of the Takovo Cross. In 1907 he was honored with the Leopold Order and knighted by the Emperor Franz Joseph I (becoming Ritter von). Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 died on 15 December 1908 in his apartment in Klagbaumgasse 17 (1040 Vienna), where he had lived since 1894. Emperor Franz Joseph I received the news of his death with great regret. A memorial service was held in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna by Bishop Nikodim Mila\u0161 of Dalmatia (1845-1915). The procession to the Viennese Central Cemetery (Wiener Zentralfriedhof, 1110 Vienna) comprised the Serbian deputy Simi\u0107, General Baron Mondel, Baron Ronfeld, several generals, the Professors Milan Re\u0161etar and Eduard Lippmann of the University of Vienna, Stratimirovi\u0107 's widow and the children. He was buried in the Serbian part 68B of the cemetery. In the same grave were buried his wife Albina (died in 1922) and his son Djordje (died in 1936). Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107's memoirs were published by his daughter Ljubica Stratimirovi\u0107 with the title \"Was ich erlebte. Erinnerungen von General von Stratimirovi\u0107\" in 1911 (Vienna-Leipzig: Braum\u00fcller; the first edition in Serbian was published in 1913)."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

He was a son of the Austrian Major General of Serbian origin and nobleman Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 Ritter von Kulpin (1822-1908). After finishing his Law Studies at the University of Vienna, he was promoted to Dr of Law on 14 July 1899. Milo\u0161 Mihailo Stratimirovi\u0107 married Hermine Langer (born on 4 November 1878) in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava in Vienna on 11 February 1901. His best man was Nikola D. Germani. They had three children: a son Djordje (Georgije Dimitrije Nikolaj), who was born on 1 April 1902 and was baptised on 13 April in the St. Sava Church. The godfather was the merchant Dimitrije Germani. On 17 April 1903 their son Milo\u0161 was born, who was baptised in the St. Sava Church on 11 May. The godfather was Djordje Mileki\u0107 Ritter von Carlowitzgrad (1864-?). Both sons were born in Schaumburgergasse 16 (1040 Vienna).  Their daughter Vera was born in Graf Starhemberg Gasse 32 (1040 Vienna) on 18 February 1905 and was baptised in the St. Sava Church on 19 March. Milo\u0161 Mihailo Stratimirovi\u0107 was a court secretary and court interpreter for the Serbian language in 1904, when he lived in Schaumburgergasse 16 (1040 Vienna). As a lawyer he opened his own office in September 1912, first in Graf Starhemberg Gasse 32 (1040 Vienna), and since December 1912 in Nibelungengasse 3 (1010 Vienna). In December 1913 Milo\u0161 Mihailo Stratimirovi\u0107 moved his office to Postgasse 6 (1010 Vienna). He was a judge (\"Bezirksrichter beim Landesgericht\") in Vienna and retired in June 1909 with the honorary title of \"Landesgerichtsrat\". After the First World War (1914-1918) Milo\u0161 Mihajlo Stratimirovi\u0107 moved to the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he was also a lawyer and a judge in Sarajevo and Novi Sad. He died in Klagenfurt (today Austria) on 11 October 1922 and was buried two days later in the Annabichl Cemetery in the Northern part of Klagenfurt. The tombstone existed until 2008."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

She was a philanthropist and one of the most important supporters of women in her time. Jelisaveta Suboti\u0107 was one of the founders of the \"Kolo Srpskih sestara\" (\"Circle of Serbian Sisters\"), one of the oldest humanitarian and patriotic societies of women among the Serbs, which still exists today in Serbia as well as in the Serbian diaspora worldwide. She established the first female charity in Novi Sad which supported young women in their education. Since 1849 her family lived in Vienna, where she met Jovan Suboti\u0107 (1817-1886). They married in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt 13 (1010 Vienna) on 1 May 1851. At the wedding were present Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) with his family, Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 (1810-1863), Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 (1831-1865), the Russian Orthodox priest Mihail Fjodorovi\u010d Rajevski (1811-1884) and Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868). Their best men were the lawyer and official Pavle Trifunac (1796-1882) and the Viennese merchant Jovan Vladislav. Their first child Dejan was born in Vienna on 7 May 1852. Jelisaveta Suboti\u0107 held lectures in the Viennese Scientific Club (\"Wissenschaftlicher Club\") on the status of women in Serbia and in the Balkan Peninsula entitled \"Nationale, soziale und Frauenfrage\" (15 December 1910) and \"Die Frau im Orient\" (30 November 1911)."

Jovan Suboti\u0107 was the editor of Serbian school books in Vienna at the beginning of the 1850s, where he settled by invitation of the Austrian politician Leopold Graf von Thun und Hohenstein (1811-1888). Jovan Suboti\u0107 married Jelisaveta Savka Suboti\u0107 (1834-1918) in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt 13 (1010 Vienna) on 1 May 1851. At the wedding were present Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) with his family, Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 (1810-1863), Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 (1831-1865), the Russian Orthodox priest Mihail Fjodorovi\u010d Rajevski (1811-1884) and Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868). Their best men were the lawyer and official Pavle Trifunac (1796-1882) and the Viennese merchant Jovan Vladislav. Their first child Dejan was born in Vienna on 7 May 1852. From 1851 to 1853 the family lived in Vienna. Jovan Suboti\u0107 supported Serbian students at that time in Vienna, for example Ilarion Ruvarac (1832-1905) and Novak Radonji\u0107 (1826-1890). His home was also always open for many Serbian students and also Viennese families. \r\nLater Jovan Suboti\u0107 became a deputy in the Sirmium County, and since 1862 he was judge in the Court of Seven in Zagreb (today Croatia). From 1865 to 1867 he was deputy and Vice-President of the Croatian Parliament, and from 1870 to 1872 editor of the newspaper \"Srpski Narod\" in Novi Sad. Jovan Suboti\u0107 was also President of the Matica Srpska. He spent his last years in Zemun (today Serbia), where he died in 1886."

His son Stefan studied at the at the Academy of Arts in Vienna since 1793. Mojsije Suboti\u0107 is the first known Serbian painter, who was working in Vienna. He was hired to do the paintings in the Greek Catholic Church of St. Barbara (\"Griechisch-katholische Kirche Sankt Barbara\", Postgasse 8-12, 1010 Vienna), which are still preserved in the chancel. The wooden furnishings in the church were made by Arsenije Markovi\u0107 (?-1799). Mojsije Suboti\u0107 also made altogether 16 smaller paintings of the high religious feasts for the church. Ten of these paintings are preserved in the chancel, among them the Ascension of Jesus Christ, St. Peter and St. Paul, Pentecost, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, etc. One of the most interesting of these paintings is the Birth of Jesus Christ, because the Austrian Post published a stamp with this painting as Christmas stamp in 1979."

After attending the grammar school in Novi Sad, he studied Medicine at the University of Vienna, where he was promoted to Dr of Medicine in 1881. Vojislav Suboti\u0107 left Vienna in 1876 to join the Serbian Army as a volunteer in Serbian-Ottoman War in 1876. Since 1881 he worked in the surgery of Professor Eduard Albert (1841-1900) until 1884. After that he left Vienna and moved to Zemun (today Serbia), where he opened his own ordination. Vojislav Suboti\u0107 settled in Belgrade in 1889, where he established the first surgery in the Palilula Hospital. Vojislav Suboti\u0107 worked there until 1907. Then he was promoted to the director of the hospital in Vra\u010dar. In the same year he organised the First Congress of Serbian Surgeons, and in 1901 he represented the Serbian Physicians' Society (\"Srpsko Lekarsko Dru\u0161tvo\") at the Physicians' Congress in Paris. In 1906 Vojislav Suboti\u0107 became President of the Serbian Physicians' Society. He worked as a surgeon in the Serbian-Bulgarian War (1885), in both Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and in the First World War (1914-1918). Vojislav Suboti\u0107 was sent to Paris and London, where he held lectures on the situation of the Serbian war surgery. In 1916 he was elected as member of the Surgical Society in Paris. In 1919 Vojislav Suboti\u0107 became a member of the Societyies of War Surgeons of the USA and England. In the same year he was elected as Professor of Surgery and Vice-Dean at the University of Medicine in Belgrade. In 1921 he became Dean of the same University. Vojislav Suboti\u0107 received many international prizes and rewards and was a member of the International Society of Surgery (\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Internationale de Chirurgie\") since 1902, the French and German Society of Surgery and the National Academy of Medicine (\"Acad\u00e9mie nationale de m\u00e9decine\")  in Paris. Vojislav Suboti\u0107 died in Belgrade on 4 December 1923. Among his 36 scholarly papers he had published almost half in renowned international (also Austrian) journals (e.g. \"Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift\", \"Wiener Medizinische Presse\" and \"Allgemeine Wiener Medizinische Zeitung\")."

              "value": "Sava Popovi\u0107 Tekelija von Kevermes (1761-1842) was the symbol of the Serbian bourgeoisie in the Austrian Empire. He was one of the most educated Serbs and famous benefactor, who bequeathed his entire property to the cultural and educational enlightenment of the Serbian people. \r\nSava Tekelija was an official, merchant, landlord and nobleman.He was the President of the \u201cMatica Srpska\u201d and the founder of the foundation \"Tekelijanum\" in Pest (today Hungary). He was born in Arad (today Romania) on 17 August 1761. After taking part in the Austro-Ottoman war, Sava's grandfather, Jovan Popovi\u0107 Tekelija, was appointed by Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) as the captain of the Serbian police (300 pistols and 200 horsemen) in 1698 and was ordered to build the fortress of Arad. In 1705 the construction of the church of St. Peter and Paul, the so-called Tekelija church, was finished. The family Tekelija remained the patron of this church until 1844, when Petar Tekelija (1784-1844), the last male descendant, died. Here is to be found the place of burial of Sava Tekelija. In 1706 Jovan Popovi\u0107 Tekelija was ennobled and received a coat of arms.\r\nIn the years 1779/80 Sava Tekelija wrote that his cousin from Russia came, gave him 100 rubles and took him to Vienna. For that money he bought a new suit and a golden watch. The first stay of Sava Tekelija in Vienna was from 1780 to 1782. Allegedly he came to Vienna by his parent's will, but he failed to enroll in the Military Academy. In Vienna he acquired rich knowledge. Sava Tekelija attended lectures at University (criminal, canonical, natural and general law, physics, anatomy, chemistry, botany), learned to draw and to play flute and the languages French, Italian and Spanish. From 1782 to 1786 he studied Law in Buda (today Hungary), where he received the title of Dr of Law as the first among the Serbs. In 1804 Sava Tekelija wrote to Napoleon I (1769-1821), proposing to him that he should establish a Kingdom of Illyria, which would include Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) with a proposal of cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.\r\nIn August 1745 Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) founded the so-called \"Illyrische Hofkommission\" for the Serbian population of her realm and its administration. On 5 August 1747 it was renamed in \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" and put under the direct control of the Habsburg ruler. The \"Illyrische Hofdeputation\" issued two Regulamenta in 1770 and 1777 and was finally dissolved in 1792. Its successor was the Hungarian Court Office. During his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798 Sava Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. He fought for the rights of the Serbian people in Hungary, but, since he had no support in the office, decided to resign in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.\r\nSince then Sava Tekelija was staying in Vienna on at least three occasions: in 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon I, which he sent through the French deputy; in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies; in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment, to take a passport. In 1838 he recorded that he saw \"steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram.\" After returning from the treatment, he stayed in Vienna in order to obtain a permission to establish his foundation, which became to be known as \"Tekelijanum\". In the \"Tekelijanum\" in Pest more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), were accepted from 1838 to 1914 and received scholarships. In addition Sava Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Viennese Engineering Academy and later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, Sava Tekelija resided again in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the \"Tekelijanum\" he also left 100,000 forints for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy. Four students, who were to be named by the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, were to receive 4,000 forints. Jovan Suboti\u0107 (1817-1886) states in his book on Sava Tekelija from 1861 that until that time 30-40 young men had already received a scholarship at the Viennese Engineering Academy. Sava Tekelija died in Arad on 21 September 1842."

Petar Tekelija was born in Kevermes (today Hungary) in 1784 as a son of Petar, Sava Tekelija's brother. Petar Tekelija had a brother Djordje and three sisters. Like his uncle Sava Tekelija, he was a great Serbian patriot and visited Serbia during the First Serbian Uprising in 1812. Before that he travelled, together with his uncle, to their cousins in the Russian Empire. Petar Tekelija was high ranking official in the Austrian Empire. He had the title of a Hungarian Court Councillor (\"k\u00f6nigl. ungarischer Rat\") and was the head (\"comes\") of the Csan\u00e1d County (today divided between Hungary and Romania). He married Marija Tekelija von Kevermes (1821-1870). After his father's death in 1820 he inherited great landed property. Petar Tekelija was also Knight of the Golden Spur (\"Ritter vom goldenen Sporn\"), which is a Papal Order of Knighthood. He died in Vienna in the house Leopoldstadt 522 (Praterstra\u00dfe 9, 1020 Vienna) on 31 July 1844 and was buried two days later in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). Petar Tekelija was the last male descendant of the noble family Tekelija."

He was an engineer, inventor, merchant and the President of the Serbian Orthodox Church Community Council of St. Sava in Vienna from 1907 to 1913. Since 1 July 1889 he and Max Mylius had the joint Company \"Theodorovi\u0107 & Cie\" (Stephansplatz 7, 1010 Vienna). Vasa Teodorovi\u0107 was the owner of several patents. Amongst others he patented and produced, together with the industrialist Georg Roth (1834-1903), the Roth-Theodorovic pistol in 1895. It was a long-recoil, locked-breech, single or double-action semi-automatic pistol.   \r\nVasa Teodorovi\u0107 married Anna Wilhelmine Hlouvitschka on 4 November 1880. They had two sons, Teodor (1893) and Milan (1887), and a daughter Olga (1888).

              "value": "Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian inventor and engineer, who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan (Military Frontier, today Croatia) in the family of the Serbian Orthodox Priest Mliutin Tesla and his wife Djuka. He immigrated to the United States of America in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse (1846-1914). In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology. George Westinghouse used Tesla's alternating current system to light the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. This success was a factor in their winning the contract to install the first power machinery at Niagara Falls, which bore Tesla's name and patent numbers. The project carried power to Buffalo by 1896. Nikola Tesla died in New York on Orthodox Christmas, 7 January 1943. Despite the fact that Nikola Tesla had never studied in Vienna, but in the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, the Council of Professors at the Viennese College of Technology (\"Technische Hochschule\") in Vienna (now TU Vienna) awarded Nikola Tesla for his work with the honorary Dr title on 19 June 1907. The official announcement of this PhD was on 3 March 1908. After the unveiling of the Nikola Tesla's bust, sculpted by Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (1883-1962), at the Vienna Technical Museum (\"Technisches Museum Wien\") on 29 June 1952, this Museum organised a conference on Nikola Tesla from 6 September to 13 September 1953. The Council Committee for Culture (\"Gemeinderatsausschu\u00df f\u00fcr Kultur\") of the City of Vienna named a street, Teslagasse, in the 21st Viennese districts after him on 15 October 1952."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

As an educated lawyer, he worked firstly in the Croatian Parliament as associate of Ban Josip Jela\u010di\u0107 (1801-1859). In 1856 he was appointed to ministerial secretary in Vienna and from 1862 to 1867 he worked as an advisor to the Croatian Court Chancellery. Ognjeslav Utje\u0161enovi\u0107 Ostro\u017einski held a title of Court Councillor (\"Hofrat\"). In his Viennese years he was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was one of the initiators of the foundation of the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava in 1860 as well as its second President from 1864 to 1870. Following Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107's death in 1864, Ognjeslav Utje\u0161enovi\u0107 Ostro\u017einski, Jovan Suboti\u0107 (1817-1886) and Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891) founded a committee, which took care for the release of Vuk's unpublished manuscripts as well as new editions of already published works and of his family. The first in a series of these works was the fifth book \"Serbian Folk Songs\", published in 1865, on the first anniversary of Vuk's death. During his stay in Vienna, Ognjeslav Utje\u0161enovi\u0107 Ostro\u017einski's son Milan (1867) and wife Jelena (1870) died. From 1875 to 1886 Ognjeslav Utje\u0161enovi\u0107 Ostro\u017einski was the governor (\u017eupan) of the Vara\u017edin County and retired in 1886.  In 1884 the Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) decorated him with the Order of Leopold, and at the same time he was ennobled as \"Ritter von\" with the title \"Ostro\u017einski\". He received also the Order of Franz Josef. Ognjeslav Utje\u0161enovi\u0107 Ostro\u017einski died in Zagreb in 1890. \r\nIn Vienna he published manifold works on the subject of the history of the Military Frontier: \r\n\"Die Hauskommunionen der S\u00fcdslaven: Eine Denkschrift zur Beleuchtung der volkst\u00fcmlichen Acker- und Familienverfassung des serbischen und des kroatischen Volkes\" (1859)\r\n \"Die Milit\u00e4rgr\u00e4nze und die Verfassung: eine Studie \u00fcber den Ursprung und das Wesen der Milit\u00e4rgr\u00e4nzinstitution und die Stellung derselben zur Landesverfassung\" (1861)\r\n\"Programm zur Konstituierung des \u00f6sterreichischen Kaiserstaates nach den Prinzipien der konstitutionellen Freiheit und der nationalen Gleichberechtigung aus dem Jahre 1848\" (1861)\r\n\"Das Donau-Adria-Bahnnetz\" (1865)\r\n\"Die Natursch\u00e4tze im n\u00f6rdlichen Croatien\" (1879)\r\n\"Lebensgeschichte des Kardinals Georg Utie\u0161enovi\u0107 genannt Martinusius: mit dessen Bildnis, Familien-Wappen u. einer Skizze der Ruinen seines Ahnenschlosses; mit Ben\u00fctzung der Akten des K.

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Stefan Vujanovski (1743-1829) was a representative of the Enlightenment among the Serbian people. He was born in Brdjani (today Croatia) in 1743. After finishing grammar school in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia), where his teacher was Jovan Raji\u0107 (1726-1801), he went to Sopron and then to Vienna in order to study Law. In 1777 he attended courses of Johann Ignaz Melchior von Felbiger (1724-1788) for primary school principals in Vienna. In the same year he was named school principal of all Serbian primary schools in the Zagreb County. In 1792 Stefan Vujanovski was ennobled to Hungarian nobility and moved to Novi Sad (today Serbia). The education reform of the Serbs was only one of a series of reforms carried out in the 1770s, which had far-reaching consequences not only on the legal and political situation of the Serbs, but also on the development of spiritual life. The reforms were implemented through two Regulations (1770 and 1777), then the Declarations (1779) and the Consistory System (1782). One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the spreading of books among the Serbs. The reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Teodor Jankovi\u0107 Mirijevski (1741-1814) in Banat, by Avram Mrazovi\u0107 (1756-1826) in Ba\u010dka and by Stefan Vujanovski in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia. They all had first completed courses held by Felbiger for primary school principals in Vienna. Stefan Vujanovski published a German grammar entitled \"\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u0458\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" in 1772 at the printing house of Josef von Kurzb\u00f6ck (1736-1792), a philological study entitled \"\u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0443\" and a short history of the Church for the schools entitled \"\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\", both in 1793, at the printing house of Stefan von Novakovi\u0107 in Vienna."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Danilo  \u017defarovi\u0107 came to Vienna in 1755 and after some time beeing in the circle of Orthodox Greeks and Serbs, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith. Danilo \u017defarovi\u0107, together with Johann Graf von Fries (1719-1785), founded a trading company on the Danube in 1777 for the trade in the Ottoman lands. Danilo \u017defarovi\u0107 was raised to Austrian nobility on 21 March 1782. He also bore the title of Privy Councillor (\"Geheimrat\"). In 1761 he married Katharina Preinl. In \u017defarovi\u0107's possession were at least five houses in Vienna, including today's House of Music in Annagasse 20 (1010 Vienna), which he had built in 1790. Intresting is that this house was from 1923 to 1941 and from 1948 to 1957 the seat of the Yugoslav embassy. Daniel \u017defarovi\u0107 built the house \"zur wei\u00dfen Rose\" in Fleischmarkt 16 (1010 Vienna) at the beginning of the 19th century (ca. 1800) and died there on 3 May 1806. On the facade, among other ornamental reliefs, there is to be seen the coat of arms of the family \u017defarovi\u0107 above the gate. His wife Katharina lived there with the family until her death in 1814. The house remained the family's property until 1925. Numerous generations, the descendants of Daniel and Katharina \u017defarovi\u0107, who still live in Austria today, have were civil servants, officers, lawyers and professors. Among them is for example Victor Leopold Ritter von Zepharovich (1830-1890), Professor of Mineralogy at the University of Prague."

              "value": "Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 (1690-1753) was a coppersmith and engraver, painter and monk, who was born ca. 1690 in Dojran (then Ottoman Empire, today Republic of North Macedonia). As a church painter of the Metropolis of Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) he came to Vienna in 1741. His works were printed by the Viennese coppersmith Thomas Me\u00dfmer. Until 1753 he was intermittently in Vienna, when he finally moved to Moscow and died in the same year. Initially, Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 had come to Vienna with his nephew Georgije \u017defarovi\u0107 (1722-1752). Georgije \u017defarovi\u0107 was the first Serbian educated painter, but unfortunately died early. Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 then adopted his sister's son Danilo \u017defarovi\u0107 (1736-1806), who was appointed as his only successor in his testament.\r\nHe printed his most famous work entitled \"Stemmatography\" (\"Stematografija\") in 1741. The role model for his publication was Pavel Ritter Vitezovi\u0107's (1652-1713) heraldic book \"Stemmatography\" from the year 1702. Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 translated from Latin into Church Slavonic and created several engravings and pictures, which are: the portraits of the Serbian Saints of the Middle Ages, especially the rulers and Saints of the Nemanji\u0107 Dynasty, the coats of arms of the 56 Slavic and other Balkan countries and coats of arms of different cities and states. The importance of the \"Stemmatography\" is remarkable, not only for the the Serb people, but also for all the other Southern Slavs. This book played an extremely important role in the spiritual awakening and enlightenment of the Serbs in the 18th century. It is also worth mentioning that it is dedicated to the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107 \u0160akabenta (1698-1748). In 1743 Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 wrote the first translation of imperial privileges for the Serbs by the Habsburg rulers Leopold I (1640-1705), Josef I (1678-1711), Charles VI (1685-1740) and Maria Theresia (1717-1780) and printed them in Vienna."

His address at that time was Marokkanergasse 18 (1030 Vienna). His best man was the journalist Djordje Djurkovi\u0107 von Rozsa-Lehota (1843-1908). They had three daughters:\r\nTatjana Zuruni\u0107 was born in Baden (today Austria) on 8 July 1900 and was baptised in the Church of St. Sava on 12 August. Roksanda Zuruni\u0107 was born on 7 August 1902 in Baden and baptised in the Church of St. Sava on 7 September. Jelenka Zuruni\u0107 was born on 7 July 1904 in Weikersdorf near Baden and baptised in the Church of St. Sava on 7 August. The godfather of all three daughters was Djordje Djurkovi\u0107 von Rozsa-Lehota. Tatjana studied at the University of Vienna from 1918 to 1922. On 23 October 1922 she married the Yugoslav diplomat Konstantin Foti\u0107 (1891-1959) in the Church of St. Sava in Vienna. Roksanda finished also her studies at the University of Vienna.

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",
