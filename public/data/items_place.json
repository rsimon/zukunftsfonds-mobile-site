Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

It is not clear what happened with King Milan's legacy. After his death all objects from the apartment were transferred to Belgrade, but after the overthrow of the Obrenovi\u0107 Dynasty in 1903 its destiny is unknown. One of the possible answers could be the two auctions in the Viennese auction house \"Dorotheum\" from 1905 and 1906. On the first auction (10-16 October 1905) Queen Natalija Obrenovi\u0107 (1859-1941), Milan's former wife, sold objects of the Kings Milan and Aleksandar. It was a collection of 1166 objects (silverware, porcelain, ivory, bronze, vases, statues, lamps, paintings and furniture from the Royal Palace in Belgrade). The second auction took place on 30 October 1906. Here were offered 126 objects, among them 110 paintings."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century.

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

The Confraternity obtained, with the support of the famous Austrian General Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), an imperial privilege by the Emperor Karl VI of Habsburg (1685-1740) in 1723, which allowed the foundation of the first Orthodox chapel in Vienna. It was dedicated to St. George and was first located in the Dempfingerhof (Seitenstettengasse 4, 1010 Vienna) and then in the Steyrerhof (Griechengasse 3, 1010 Vienna). The Confraternity received imperial privileges by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) and the Emperors Joseph II (1741-1790), Leopold II (1747-1792) and Franz II (1768-1835). In 1803 Georg Johann Ritter von Karajan (1743-1813), a Greek with Austrian citizenship, bought two houses (No. 758 \"zum kleinen K\u00fc\u00dfdenpfennig Haus\" and No. 757 \"Wagner-\" or \"Binder-H\u00e4uschen\") in the Griechengasse and ceded both to the Confraternity. In the same year the headstone for a Church of St. George was laid and it was built by the architect Franz Wipplinger (1760-1812) until 1806 at a cost of 126,784 florins. It was renovated through the generosity of the Greek banker and industrialist Nikolaos Dumba (1830-1900) in the year 1898. A belfry was erected by the architect Ludwig Tischler (1840-1906). After more than 100 years His Eminence Metropolitan Arsenios of Austria accomplished an extensive renovation of the church in the years 2015/2016. The Greek Orthodox Church of St. George is the oldest Orthodox church on the territory of the Republic of Austria. In the past and the present many generations of Orthodox Christians joined in this church for prayer. Jekatarina-Katica Obrenovi\u0107 (1826-1848), the daughter of Prince Milo\u0161's youngest brother Jevrem Obrenovi\u0107 (1790-1856), died in Vienna on 25 July 1848 and, after a memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). In 1885 a memorial service was held for the Serbian Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevi\u0107 (1806-1885) by Bishop Djordje Brankovi\u0107 and 17 other clergymen in this very church."

The Confraternity bought a house in Fleischmarkt 13 (1010 Vienna), which was transformed into a church by the architect Peter Mollner (1732-1801). The Confraternity received imperial privileges by the Habsburg emperors Joseph II (1741-1790) in 1787 and by Franz II (1768-1835) in 1796. The renovation of the Church of the Holy Trinity took place in 1833 and from 1856 to 1858. The renovation in the 1850s was mostly financed by Baron Simon von Sina (1810-1876), who donated an amount of 70,000 florins. The renowned architect Theophil von Hansen (1813-1891) created a facade and church spire in Neo-Byzantine-style, which the Viennese population called \"Das goldene Haus\" (\"The Golden House\"). The church's last renovation was undertaken from 1989 to 1993.\r\nJovan Suboti\u0107 (1817-1886) and Jelisaveta Savka Suboti\u0107 (1834-1918) married in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity on 1 May 1851. At the wedding were present Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 (1787-1864) with his family, Djordje Stojakovi\u0107 (1810-1863), Kornelije Stankovi\u0107 (1831-1865), the Russian Orthodox priest Mihail Fjodorovi\u010d Rajevski (1811-1884) and Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868). Their best men were the lawyer and official Pavle Trifunac (1796-1882) and the Viennese merchant Jovan Vladislav.\r\nOn 10 May 1854 Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 (1823-1868) was best man at the wedding of Major General Djordje Stratimirovi\u0107 (1822-1908) in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity. \r\nCezar Popovi\u0107 (1876-1938), a Viennese architect and artist, was baptised in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 21 March 1876. In 1890 a memorial service was celebrated in the church for the Austrian General and nobleman Gavrilo Rodi\u0107 (1812-1890)."

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

After the conquest of Ottoman Belgrade by the Austrian general Laudon on 8 October 1789 he ordered that parts of Ottoman stone sculptures from the fortress of Belgrade (called \"Kalemegdan\") were to be brought to Vienna as symbol of victory. They comprise two marble plaques, which were put on the Stambul Gate of the fortress of Belgrade under the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I (1696-1754), and four smaller plaques of marble deriving from the tomb of the former commander of the fortress, Ibrahim Pasha, who died in 1708. These stone sculptures are still to be found in the forest of Laudon's former estate in Hadersdorf, to the North of Schlo\u00df Laudon alongside the Mauerbachstra\u00dfe."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Mit dem Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs am 28. Juli 1914 gelang es der Armee des Zarenreiches Ru\u00dfland zun\u00e4chst, in der Bukowina und in Ostgalizien tief auf das Staatsgebiet \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns einzudringen. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass die dortige (zu einem betr\u00e4chtlichen Teil orthodoxe) Bev\u00f6lkerung floh / fliehen musste und in der Folge in andere Teile der Monarchie evakuiert werden musste. Die Statthalterei von Nieder\u00f6sterreich (damals das Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich unter der Enns) erlie\u00df ein Rundschreiben an alle Bezirkshauptmannschaften und fragte an, ob die M\u00f6glichkeit zur Aufnahme dieser Kriegsfl\u00fcchtlinge best\u00fcnde. Oberhollabrunn (jetzt Teil der Stadt Hollabrunn, Nieder\u00f6sterreich) war wegen des Bedarfs an Hilfskr\u00e4ften in der Landwirtschaft dazu bereit. Im Februar 1915 befand sich rund eine halbe Million Kriegsfl\u00fcchtlinge aus Galizien in verschiedenen Teilen der Monarchie, davon rund 25.000 in Nieder\u00f6sterreich. Die gro\u00dfe Anzahl von Fl\u00fcchtlingen auf dem Gebiet von Oberhollabrunn f\u00fchrte schlie\u00dflich zur \u00dcberlegung, ebendort ein eigenes Fl\u00fcchtlingslager zu errichten. Einer der f\u00fchrenden Initiatoren dieser Idee war der damalige B\u00fcrgermeister von Oberhollabrunn, Dr. Rudolf Kolisko (1859-1942, B\u00fcrgermeister 1908-1919), der Gemeindegrundst\u00fccke s\u00fcdlich bzw. s\u00fcd\u00f6stlich des Ortes zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen wollte, damit diese infrastrukturell zu einem Fl\u00fcchtlingslager ausgebaut w\u00fcrden, das nach dem Krieg als Stadterweiterungsgebiet (Stichwort: Gartenstadt) einverleibt werden sollte. Das Lager war f\u00fcr 5.000 Fl\u00fcchtlinge konzipiert. B\u00fcrgermeister Kolisko unterst\u00fctzte die zentralen Beh\u00f6rden der Monarchie tatkr\u00e4ftig im Wege seiner Stadtgemeinde, indem er eine Wasserleitung, einen Hauptsammelkanal und eine Schmalspurbahn vom Stationsgeb\u00e4ude der Nordwestbahn bis zum Lager errichten lie\u00df sowie die Elektrifizierung des Areals gew\u00e4hrleistete. An Unterk\u00fcnften wurden einerseits Familienh\u00e4user in fester Bauweise und andererseits Baracken aus Holz erbaut. Es entstand eine komplette, autarke Infrastruktur mit Geb\u00e4uden f\u00fcr die Lagerverwaltung, mit einer Schule, einer W\u00e4scherei, Werkst\u00e4tten, Wachh\u00e4usern, St\u00e4llen f\u00fcr Rinder und Schweine, Wirtschaftsgeb\u00e4uden, einer Quarant\u00e4nebaracke, einer Spitalsbaracke, einem Feuerwehrzeughaus, einer Kirche und mit einem Gasthaus. Insgesamt wurden rund 109 Objekte errichtet. Im Sommer 1916 war das Fl\u00fcchtlingslager in Betrieb und beherbergte im September 1916 bereits 2.000 Fl\u00fcchtlinge aus Ostgalizien und der Bukowina. Eine gro\u00dfe Gefahr f\u00fcr die Fl\u00fcchtlinge ging von Krankheiten, hier vor allem vom Flecktyphus, aus. Die Mortalit\u00e4t im Lager d\u00fcrfte (wie generell in der Bev\u00f6lkerung der Monarchie im Verlaufe des Krieges) sehr hoch gewesen sein, was die Evidenz der Totenscheine der verstorbenen Orthodoxen erahnen l\u00e4sst, die wir in unserem Projekt im Detail erforschen.\r\nAufgelassen wurde das Fl\u00fcchtlingslager Oberhollabrunn, das zur Zeit der st\u00e4rksten Belegung \u00fcber 4.000 Fl\u00fcchtlinge beherbergte, schlie\u00dflich Ende April 1918 und wurde mit der Ausrufung der Ersten Republik am 12. November 1918 einer neuen Verwendung zugef\u00fchrt. Ab Dezember 1918 wurden Kinder zwischen 14 und 16 Jahren seitens der Stadt Wien zwecks Erholung in den verlassenen Geb\u00e4uden untergebracht, womit ein neues Kapitel der Geschichte begann."

However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time.

The Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) accepted the Mekhitarist monks in December 1810. Initially in 1811 the Mekhitarist fathers found shelter in the deserted buildings of the old Capucine convent \"Am Platzl\" in the suburb of St. Ulrich. In 1837 they started with the erection of new premises. The main wing of the new monastery followed the lines of the Mechitaristengasse (1070 Vienna). In 1874 two cross wings and a new church were added and so the monastery reached its present configuration. \r\nThe Mekhitarist monks established a publishing house in 1811 and were active until 1873. From 1873 to 1876 the publishing house was in possession of Karl Seidl and Felix Mayer. This publishing house is of the greatest importance for the history of Serbian literacy and literature. It was the first publishing house in the world, which used Vuk Karadzi\u0107's (1787-1864) orthography (30 letters), and his \"Rije\u010dnik\" (\"Dictionary\", 1818) was printed as the first book in history with this new orthography. \r\nIn the publishing house of the Mekhitarist Congregation Djordje Nato\u0161evi\u0107 (1821-1887) published pedagogic books, for example spelling instructions for teachers in Vienna in 1858 (\"\u0423\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0410\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\")."

              "value": "The permanent settlement of Serbs in Vienna began in the course of the 17th century. The first settlers were merchants, who transported goods from the Ottoman to the Habsburg Empire and were thus granted freedom of trade by the Habsburg emperor Leopold I (1640-1705) in 1670.  A larger number of Serbs most probably reached Vienna in connection with the second Ottoman siege of 1683. The siege lasted from 14 July to 12 September 1683. Since the garrison was cut off from the Austrian and Polish relieving force, scouts were needed for the exchange of letters and messages between the separated bodies of troops. At least one of them was a merchant of Serbian origin, namely Georg Thomas Michaelowitz. After the Ottoman defeat the Serbs most probably founded their own area of settlement outside the city walls called \"Ratzenstadel\" (\u201cRazen Stadtl\u201d), which derives from the Hungarian word for Serb (\u201cR\u00e1c\u201d) and the German deductions \"Raizen, Raitzen, Rascier\", which again points to the Serbian medieval region of \"Ra\u0161ka\" (also known today as Novi Pazar, Serbia). The \"Ratzenstadel\" lay in the sixth district (1060) of Vienna, which is today \"Mariahilf\".\r\n\"Im Volksmund wurde die Vorstadt das (!) Ratzenstadel genannt. Der Begriff d\u00fcrfte sich von den Serben oder Raizen ableiten, die dort ihre ersten Wohnst\u00e4tten in Wien hatten.\" Cf. https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Magdalenengrund_(Vorstadt)"

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

The huge complex of buildings called B\u00fcrgerspital was demolished in the 1870s and 1880s. It was located between today's Maysedergasse, Neuer Markt, K\u00e4rntner Stra\u00dfe and Lobkowitzplatz.

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "value": "Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojakovi\u0107 (1811-1863). The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Raja\u010di\u0107 (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.\r\nUntil the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the \"Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors\" (\u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e-\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u045b\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u0447\u0443, \u0418\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers. \r\nAfter the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality. \r\nOn 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\r\nThe first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mi\u0161i\u0107 (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popovi\u0107 (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojakovi\u0107 (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).\r\nIn 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (\"Serbischer Frauen Wohlt\u00e4tigkeitsverein\"). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostoji\u0107 (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostoji\u0107 (1839-1917)."

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

              "description": "This research project focuses on one of the aspects of the history and presence of Orthodox Christians, and in particular of the Orthodox Serbs, in Vienna. Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",

Quite often the opinion emerges in the contemporary public discourse that the Orthodox Christians have come to Austria for the first time in the wake of the so-called \"Gastarbeiterbewegung\" of the 1960s and 1970s. However, their history and presence in Austria dates well back to the 17th century. In fact, according to the Austro-Hungarian population census of 1910, more than 2,000,000 Serbs lived in the Habsburg monarchy: in Hungary a total of 1,106,471, in Bosnia and Herzegovina 825,338 and in Dalmatia 105,000.\r\nThis research project uses biographical data on the Orthodox Serbs in Vienna in the period from 1741 until 1918 in order to illustrate how the Orthodox began to migrate to the Habsburg Empire, how Orthodox merchants settled in Vienna and how they integrated into Viennese society of that time. On the basis of meticulously researched data in Austrian archives the life of famous Serbs in Vienna is reconstructed. Their places of dwelling and action are localised and embedded into a customised OpenAtlas database with an online Geoportal, which will be open to the interested public at the end of the project.\r\nThis project aims to gain a better understanding of contemporary developments and future trends in Orthodox Christianity based on scholarly research on famous Serbian personalities of the 18th and 19th centuries in detail, which were already integrated into Austrian society at that time in Vienna as well as in Austria in general.\r\n",
