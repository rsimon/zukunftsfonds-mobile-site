# Zukunftsfonds Mobile Site

Mobile site UI Design for the Zukunftsfonds project.

__Note:__ places outside Austria (i.e. birth places) do not have coordinates yet. I added coordinates 
manually for one place, to have a test example: __Badeutz__, birth place of __Wasilie Dimitrescul__.

__Note:__ there's currently an issue with the images hosted at the ÖAW server. A set of sample images
(hosted locally) is available for the Church St. Sava, and Prince Miloš Obrenović. 

## TODOs

- Large images not loading (hard limitation on physical devices?)
- Filter by projects?
- Global map (with movement arrows?) as alternative entry point (make arrows clickable!)
- Make profile maps "static"?
- Metadata to enable the 'add to home screen' popup?
- Theme color?
- Add Help page
- Pages are rendering twice + there is a glitch after transition animation has finished
- We need an icon!

## Changelog

- Behavior tweak: same page doesn't "open" twice (e.g. navigating from Home to Home just closes the sidebar)
