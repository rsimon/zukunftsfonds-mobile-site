# Zukunftsfonds Mobile Site

Mobile site UI Design for the Zukunftsfonds project.

__Note:__ places outside Austria (i.e. birth places) do not have coordinates yet. I added coordinates 
manually for one place, to have a test example: __Badeutz__, birth place of __Wasilie Dimitrescul__.

## TODOs

- Large images not loading (hard limitation on physical devices?)
- Filter by projects?
- Global map (with movement arrows?) as alternative entry point
- Metadata to enable the 'add to home screen' popup?
- Theme color?
